          <strong>00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.629 David Ornelas:</strong>
          <span> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:28.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>
          <span> My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish, I usually tack on the 1st initial of my 1st name J, and my research interest’s kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</span>
        </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">What inspired you to start on your academic journey? And how did that lead you into writing your book, “Queer Silence: On Disability and Rhetorical Absence”?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.579 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span> Although your queer silence on disability and rhetorical silence book was big, how did that—what was your journey that sparked that? And then going into Crip Negativity, and the rest of your books?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.876 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Oh, goodness! Well,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:59.230 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Queer Silence, my first book, was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about 50% of my dissertation found its way into the book.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:17.280 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And I note that because my dissertation was very much the culmination of a series of questions that led me to grad school to begin with. I spent a good deal of my adolescence in conversion therapy</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.520 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> which</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:42.799 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> offered me a deeply harmful but nevertheless comprehensive framework to think about the relationship between sexuality and disability, and after finishing—and in many ways surviving—conversion therapy, I was left with a lot of questions about that relationship</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:59.540 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> between, well, my own experience of sexuality and disability, notwithstanding the disabilities I have that are somewhat independent, or not necessarily as intimately connected to my sexuality. And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> I entered grad school really wanting to understand better what I experienced and how the language we use to talk about disability and sexuality—particularly in relation—</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.890 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> can shape what people experience on an embodied level with these kinds of identities.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.652 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And so Queer Silence</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:47.369 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> was an attempt to answer a lot of those questions, and in the dissertation—the first iteration of that project—I was really primarily focused on sexuality and thinking about how people</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.579 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> within sexual minorities</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:12.480 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> have to drum up strategies to survive that don’t always seem or register to others as particularly radical or resilient, but nevertheless are highly effective at keeping people alive or keeping people safe. And then,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.669 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> when I finished</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.069 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> graduate school and moved toward the book, I felt a lot more freedom to think a little more expansively</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:40.009 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> about not only the relationship between queerness and silence, or sexuality and silence, but also disability — which, of course, is really the primary focus of the book iteration of the project.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.469 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And since Queer Silence, I have continued to be</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:45.610 --> 00:04:00.909 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference, about coalition, because something that I</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.069 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> learned in the process of writing Queer Silence was that the</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:26.159 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> tension we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.759 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> on a kind of rhetorical level.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:41.070 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> But it’s also one that has really deep implications for how queer disabled people understand themselves—how I understand myself.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.760 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:52.089 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> I have continued to write projects, to work on projects—including Crip Negativity and some of my</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:20.480 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> work since then—that try to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don’t always get along as well as we would like them to.</span>

        <button class="accordion-btn">The bodies you mention in your book, how are they mediated through technology? Do “bodies” serve one or many purposes that you’re conveying in your book?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:46.930 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span> Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember in reading the 1st chapter or so of Crip Negativity. You talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Do bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.000 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.940 Logan Smilges</strong>
            <span>through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:25.221 Logan Smilges</strong>
            <span>There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embeddedness</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.640 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>through and in and in that chapter</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:42.730 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:43.150 --> 00:07:09.400 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. And I think there are lots of other examples we can</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.430 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>include.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:21.085 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:33.450 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness</span>
          </p>
         
          <p>
            <strong>00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:46.590 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus</span>
          </p> 

          <p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.749 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>now that all said, I think</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.360 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I think there's also a degree to which</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:29.659 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. And in this way, I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:42.869 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>through like technological limbs. But or hearing aids, or also through other forms of assisted communication.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:55.529 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>that are also kind of technologically robust. So, in these cases, I back. I would back away a little bit from thinking about</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:05.185 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:25.690 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Vicea have written a lot about figures of crypt cyborgs that are such good examples of the real</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.410 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>harmony that can take place between bodies and technology.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:45.619 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>You and I have been speaking, I think, since like 2021, and my master's thesis at SDSU was on Grindr, and I heavily resonated with what you wrote about on Chris has especially the chapter on Grindr.</span>

            <span>because what I wrote about my thesis was like the misconceptions that gay men have other gay men while on grinder in this digital space, where you don't know the person, you only see them through their profile picture and the bio they have, and whatever information they've included in that which leads into my next question is through your writing. Do you talk about queer digital spaces? And how do people embody them?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.870 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Can. Can you ask that? The the kind of tail end of that question? One more time</span>

            <strong>00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.869 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>Yes. So, through your writing, you talk about current digital spaces, but how do they embody them?</span>

            <strong>00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.290 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>How do people occupy these queer digital spaces?</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.060 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>Yes.</span>

            <strong>00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.210 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Well, there's such a range, right? And I think this is one of the things that can make.</span>

            <span>on the one hand, so promising and enlivening, and also deeply frustrating for people who use them. You know, it's so rare to encounter a queer person who's like I love the apps, the apps make me so happy, you know. I just can't wait to finish my day at work. Sit down and get on the apps like nobody. Nobody says that right.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:24.628 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Everyone is upset about the apps. No one likes them, and yet they are so widely popular. Now, I'll be honest with you. I actually have not used like a queer dating app. Since, like 2017, it has been. It's been a long time since I have actively used them myself.</span>
          </p>

          <p>

            <strong>00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.490 David Ornelas:</strong>

          <p>
            <strong>00:27:42.560 --> 00:28:00.850 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>Yes, so I think I'm kind of referring also to again what you just said about silence within the classroom from cisgender students who maybe like not that they don't relate to the curriculum being taught, but they just feel like there's a distance between them and the curriculum in the class. So the silent discourse. That's kind of what I'm referring to.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.739 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Okay. So, folks who are participating in the discourse through their silence</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.300 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>Yeah.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.200 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Okay.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:34.320 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I mean, I think one of the one of the more challenging one of the reasons that this question is challenging is that silence can mean so many different things, right? Especially when it's coming from students. Some students are going to be silent because they've learned what we want them to learn, which is that it's okay to not speak</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:49.110 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>right. And they're intentionally engaging silence as a way of allowing others to speak. And that's great but there are other times when students engage silence, because they, because it comes from a place</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.099 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>of discomfort</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:15.740 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>when it comes from a place of insecurity. It comes from a place of perceived deficit where they don't feel they don't feel empowered to speak. They don't feel like they would be listened listened to, or maybe they're even afraid of forms of retribution or response, were they to speak? And so I think</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:27.390 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>it's very important to always take silence in context.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:29.420 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>It.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:53.159 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>It can be really dangerous, actually, to form kind of universal theories of what silence means. And this is one of the critiques that I offer in queer silence of how a lot of the history of queer activism has been predicated on rather universal theories of silence as a bad thing.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:03.760 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>But of course, that that assumption does a lot of real damage to the multiplicity of silences.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:14.820 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>You asked specifically about online writing spaces. Were you thinking about like social media</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:24.679 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>That. Yes, of course. And just online work that's done that students have to do like for classic discussion boards or peer reviews, stuff like that</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>

          <p>

            <span>with those examples? Like such a such as a discussion board?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:58.040 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>This is a great way to think about silence, not only as a kind of verbal absence, but as a kind of more multimodal gestural phenomenon, because, as every teacher who has taught online is familiar. There are many students who will use a lot of words to say absolutely nothing</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:12.029 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>right? And this is this becomes all the more common when, as when as AI increasingly becomes commonplace. In students’ kind of</span>

            <strong>00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.829 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>And so, while these forms of discoursing</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:34.109 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>are not silent in the sense that they're absent. They do engage a kind of silence in so far as they withhold</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.970 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>a lot of depth. They withhold forms of</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:31:39.040 --> 00:32:02.829 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>engagement that we that we're hoping for from our students. And once again, I think that that withholding can mean a lot of different things. Sometimes, of course, students just don't want to do the work that's not unique to students. All of us don't want to do what our work sometimes, so I don't want to blame students too much for that.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:12.470 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>but it is the case. Sometimes students don't want to do the work other times. Other times, students. They have other priorities.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:25.781 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>you know, or similar to in class. They're not convinced that, you know, pouring their heart into a response is going to to offer them much</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.058 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>much good, you know. And I think,</span>

            <strong>00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:38.900 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I think we can learn a lot from students’ kind of forms of</span>

            <span>disengagement online. I think maybe disengagement is a nice kind of corollary to silence.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.570 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>So, for example.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:37.630 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Grindr makes it possible for some queer people to engage in visual or embodied silences</span>

          <p>

            <span>that they could not engage through other forms of communication, particularly those that are Irl.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.120 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Right?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.210 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>So there there are some ways in which</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.080 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Grindr makes more silence more possible.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:07.91 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>But there are other ways in which digital communication platforms, like Grindr can also restrict people's capacity for silence.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:18.873 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Or, yeah, yeah, restrict people's capacity for silence and I think this</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:28.850 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>a good example of this is folks who, because</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:36.449 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>they choose to engage in a kind of visual silence or embodied silence.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:42.060 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>they find it much more difficult to like, interact</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.509 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>with other users on the app</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:50.570 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>right. They are like verbally silenced because no one responds to their messages.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:09.069 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>And I think that kind of that kind of silencing is a is not necessarily unique</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:18.570 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> to the platform, because that also can occur. Irl, where people just like don't respond to you. It is nevertheless conditioned by the app.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:32.760 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I guess. What I'm trying to say is that I I try to resist thinking about</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.439 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>a single form of communication, as either like</span>

          <p>

            <span>good or bad, for silence, and more so, simply altering the forms of absence that are possible.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:57.000 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> you know, in a, in a club or in a gay bar, there are.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:12.589 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>there are forms of silence that people can engage there, too, that are not possible on on an app, you know, and these one example that comes to mind for me is folks who</span>

            <p>
            <strong>00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.080 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>are verbally silent, but are still dancing with people.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:24.960 Logan Smilges<:</strong>
            <span>and like making physical contact contact, and like making out and like. There are forms of embodied presence</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:34.590 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>in person that require absolutely 0 verbal communication, whereas on an app like Grindr</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.769 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>there's always a verbal foreplay.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:54.269 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Right? You gotta set it up. And so yeah, I I like that. I like that. Your question uses the word influence like, how does it? How how do these platforms influence silence rather than simply</span>
          </p>

          <p>

            <span>No, I really like that example, because, like you said, you're in a club, and you're seeing someone in real life where on Grand or you're talking to, you know, sometimes a blank profile. You don't even know who you're talking to and like you said early on like that. That in itself is a form of talking. And amongst guys. So, I really like that.</span>
