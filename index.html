  <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Within the queer community, digital spaces remain limited and sparce, places where belonging coexists uneasily with surveillance, risk, and identity management. One such space is the app Grindr. From its inception, Grindr facilitated encounters between gay men within a geographical radius, streamlining queer visibility through visual self-presentation. Yet, the platform’s image-centric design favoring clean, cropped chest or face shots perpetuates narrow body norms and fosters what Dr. J. Logan Smilges critiques as “rhetorical silence”: moments when users with non-normative, disabled, trans, or racialized bodies quietly opt out of total legibility. In doing so, they resist being fully seen, carving out survival.</p>

<p>Contemporary queer rhetorics especially when examined alongside writing and digital pedagogy foreground tensions between visibility and safety, identity and institutional demands. Students in writing classrooms often balance authenticity with the need to conform; they learn to speak out or stay silent depending on perceived risk. Grindr’s design mirrors this tension. It nudges users toward streamlined narratives edited bios, curated images while simultaneously acknowledging the parts of queer identity that must remain hidden for bodily, social, or emotional safety.</p>

<h2>Webtext Breakdown & Kairos Connection</h2>

<p>This webtext situates itself at the intersection of queer rhetorics, digital technology, and pedagogical design. The tabs located within my Webtext form a dynamic rhetorical journey moving from spoken conversation to analytic unravelling, from method to reflection. Each tab represents a component of my interview with Dr. Smilges as I focus my attention on their scholarship within the realm of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy.</p>

<p>Kairos calls for multimodal explorations of how rhetoric and technology shape pedagogy. Here, rhetoric is not static; it is shaped by algorithms, interfaces, temporalities. They challenge standard composition pedagogy by gesturing toward multimodal literacies, including silence and embodiment. This webtext enacts those pedagogies, deploying tabs, transcript chunks, audio clips, and analytic commentary to invite readers to pause, reflect, and reassemble meaning. Although Dr. Smilges and my research focus on Grindr’s components, in the interview Dr. Smilges connects queer silence to technology (digital spaces), and pedagogy with rhetoric.</p>

<h2>Featured Scholar: Dr. J. Logan Smilges</h2>

<p>Dr. J. Logan Smilges, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia in the Department of English Language and Literatures, research at the nexus of queer/trans disability studies, the history of medicine, and rhetorical studies. Their first book, Queer Silence: On Disability and Rhetorical Absence (University of Minnesota Press, 2022), explores how silence operates not as absence, but as a strategic rhetorical modality for queer disabled subjects. They followed this with Crip Negativity (2023), a critique of liberal disability politics, pushing toward more expansive conceptions of disability liberation.</p>

<p>Smilges’s scholarly influence extends through numerous peer-reviewed articles, including “White Squares to Black Boxes: Grindr, Queerness, Rhetorical Silence” (Rhetoric Review, 2019), which parses how Grindr profiles mediate queer visibility through visual silence a key foundation for this project. Their work has earned prestigious honors the Lavender Rhetorics Award, Presidents Dissertation Award, Denise Haunani Solomon Teaching Award all signaling their innovative contributions to queer, trans, and disability rhetorics. With pronounced commitments to transfeminism, disability justice, and accessible pedagogy, they stand as a guiding voice for this project’s intersections of rhetoric and digital learning. Through the interview, Dr. Smilges speaks on these intersections in relation to silence, embodiment, digital spaces.</p>

<h2>Connection To My Own Research</h2>

<p>My doctoral thesis investigates queer rhetorics within Grindr...</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt – Visual Rhetoric:</strong>  
“In their recently published book, <em>Queer Silence</em>... (Smilges, 2022, p. 73)”</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt – Digital Rhetoric:</strong>  
“In 2019, Smilges wrote that Grindr users... (Smilges, 2022, p. 70)”</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This webtext aspires to do more than critique interfaces—it attempts to model rhetorical strategies for queers navigating digital and institutional environments...</p>
