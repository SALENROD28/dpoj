  <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Within the queer community, digital spaces remain limited and sparce, places where belonging coexists uneasily with surveillance, risk, and identity management. One such space is the app Grindr. From its inception, Grindr facilitated encounters between gay men within a geographical radius, streamlining queer visibility through visual self-presentation. Yet, the platform’s image-centric design favoring clean, cropped chest or face shots perpetuates narrow body norms and fosters what Dr. J. Logan Smilges critiques as “rhetorical silence”: moments when users with non-normative, disabled, trans, or racialized bodies quietly opt out of total legibility. In doing so, they resist being fully seen, carving out survival.</p>

<p>Contemporary queer rhetorics especially when examined alongside writing and digital pedagogy foreground tensions between visibility and safety, identity and institutional demands. Students in writing classrooms often balance authenticity with the need to conform; they learn to speak out or stay silent depending on perceived risk. Grindr’s design mirrors this tension. It nudges users toward streamlined narratives edited bios, curated images while simultaneously acknowledging the parts of queer identity that must remain hidden for bodily, social, or emotional safety.</p>

<h2>Webtext Breakdown & Kairos Connection</h2>

<p>This webtext situates itself at the intersection of queer rhetorics, digital technology, and pedagogical design. The tabs located within my Webtext form a dynamic rhetorical journey moving from spoken conversation to analytic unravelling, from method to reflection. Each tab represents a component of my interview with Dr. Smilges as I focus my attention on their scholarship within the realm of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy.</p>

<p>Kairos calls for multimodal explorations of how rhetoric and technology shape pedagogy. Here, rhetoric is not static; it is shaped by algorithms, interfaces, temporalities. They challenge standard composition pedagogy by gesturing toward multimodal literacies, including silence and embodiment. This webtext enacts those pedagogies, deploying tabs, transcript chunks, audio clips, and analytic commentary to invite readers to pause, reflect, and reassemble meaning. Although Dr. Smilges and my research focus on Grindr’s components, in the interview Dr. Smilges connects queer silence to technology (digital spaces), and pedagogy with rhetoric.</p>

<h2>Featured Scholar: Dr. J. Logan Smilges</h2>

<p>Dr. J. Logan Smilges, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia in the Department of English Language and Literatures, research at the nexus of queer/trans disability studies, the history of medicine, and rhetorical studies. Their first book, Queer Silence: On Disability and Rhetorical Absence (University of Minnesota Press, 2022), explores how silence operates not as absence, but as a strategic rhetorical modality for queer disabled subjects. They followed this with Crip Negativity (2023), a critique of liberal disability politics, pushing toward more expansive conceptions of disability liberation.</p>

<p>Smilges’s scholarly influence extends through numerous peer-reviewed articles, including “White Squares to Black Boxes: Grindr, Queerness, Rhetorical Silence” (Rhetoric Review, 2019), which parses how Grindr profiles mediate queer visibility through visual silence a key foundation for this project. Their work has earned prestigious honors the Lavender Rhetorics Award, Presidents Dissertation Award, Denise Haunani Solomon Teaching Award all signaling their innovative contributions to queer, trans, and disability rhetorics. With pronounced commitments to transfeminism, disability justice, and accessible pedagogy, they stand as a guiding voice for this project’s intersections of rhetoric and digital learning. Through the interview, Dr. Smilges speaks on these intersections in relation to silence, embodiment, digital spaces.</p>

<h2>Connection To My Own Research</h2>

<p>My doctoral thesis investigates queer rhetorics within Grindr, tracing how identity is composed, punctuated by constraints on self-representation. In dialogue with Smilges, I conceptualize these constraints as forms of rhetorical quieting what they describe through silence as resistance. In our interview (see Transcript tab), Smilges remarks, “those blank or chest-only profile pictures enact a politics of refusal” (Transcript, line 142), positioning silence as a rhetorical strategy that protects and asserts non-normative embodiment.</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt – Visual Rhetoric:</strong>  
</p>“In their recently published book, <em>Queer Silence</em>In their recently published book, Queer Silence: on disability and rhetorical absence author J. Logan Smilges (2022), defines the importance of visual rhetoric that is specifically within Grindr’s app: 
Visual rhetoric is a broad category that contains both “the cultural practices of seeing and looking, as well as the artifacts produced in diverse communicative forms and media. As it pertains to this chapter, visual refers to both the act of seeing and the artifacts that are seen, considering that users on Grindr are both witness to others’ profiles and the objects of other gazes. (Smilges, 2022, p. 73) 
Smilges takes an approach to identifying not only the visual rhetoric within the app itself, but they stress the importance of “diverse communicative forms and media” which can be seen through their advertisements. Smilges expands even more as they identify visual rhetoric going beyond just one image but aspects of Rhetorical Theory in “light of the persistent problem of the image” (p. 75).</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt – Digital Rhetoric:</strong>  
</p>Another way of looking at a form of digital rhetoric, Smilges offers an alternative view of men within the app connecting to identities. Smilges states (2019), “interacting with a digital world that both acknowledges the presence of a queer community and simultaneously conceals the identities of its community members” (Smilges, 2019, para. 4).  Instead of focusing mainly only on the identities we see within the app, there is another perception of how those identities are in real life, outside of the app. The rhetorical implication of this idea focuses on how the app “conceals the identities of its community members” (para. 4). To Smilges’ point, users may see men within their community but just  because the pictures represent them as “fit” or “muscular” on the app doesn’t mean they look  the same outside of the app. Simultaneously, Smilges expands on the notion of identity by  pointing out that “certainly, some users may choose to feature their abs or hamstrings  because they believe those parts are their most attractive features, the features most likely to  attract someone for a quick hookup” (Smilges, 2022, p. 70).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This webtext aspires to do more than critique interfaces, it attempts to model rhetorical strategies for queers navigating digital and institutional environments. It invites readers, students, scholars, educators to question the normative demands embedded within apps and classrooms, to locate silences not as failures but as rhetorical acts. By centering Smilges’s scholarship and my own research, this project signals toward pedagogies that honor queerness, and disability.</p>
