      <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>
      
      <p><strong>00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.629 David Ornelas<strong>: So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests<p>
      <p><strong>00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:28.340 Logan Smilges<strong>: My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish I usually tack on the 1st initial of my 1st name Jay, and my research interestâ€™s kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine
      <p><strong>00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.579 David Ornelas<strong>: Although your career science on disability and rhetorical absence book was really big, how did that like? What was your journey that sparked that? And then going into crypt negativity, and the rest of your books
      <p><strong>00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.876 Logan Smilges<strong>: Oh, goodness! Well,
      <p><strong>00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:59.230 Logan Smilges<strong>: queer silence! My 1st book was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about 50% of my dissertation found its way into the book.
      <p><strong>00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:17.280 Logan Smilges<strong>: and I note that because my dissertation was very much the culmination of a series of questions that led me to grad school. To begin with, I spent a good deal of my adolescence in conversion therapy
      <p><strong>00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.520 Logan Smilges<strong>: which
      <p><strong>00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:42.799 Logan Smilges<strong>: offered me a deeply harmful but nevertheless comprehensive framework to think about the relationship between sexuality and disability, and after finishing and in many ways surviving conversion therapy, I was left with a lot of questions about about that relationship
      <p><strong>00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:59.540 Logan Smilges<strong>: between well, my own experience of sexuality and disability, notwithstanding the disabilities I have that are somewhat independent, or not necessarily as intimately connected to my sexuality. And so
      <p><strong>00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.340 Logan Smilges<strong>: I entered grad school, really wanting to understand better what I experienced and how the language that we have to talk about disability and sexuality, particularly in relation.
      <p><strong>00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.890 Logan Smilges<strong>: can shape what people experience on an embodied level of these kind of identities.
      <p><strong>00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.652 Logan Smilges<strong>: And so queer silence.
      <p><strong>00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:47.369 Logan Smilges<strong>: Was an attempt to answer a lot of those questions. And in the dissertation the kind of 1st iteration of that project I was really primarily focused on sexuality and thinking about how people
      <p><strong>00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.579 Logan Smilges<strong>: within sexual minorities
      <p><strong>00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:12.480 Logan Smilges<strong>: have to drum up strategies to survive that don't always seem or register to others as particularly radical or resilient, but nevertheless are highly effective at keeping people alive or keeping people safe. And then.
      <p><strong>00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.669 Logan Smilges<strong>: when I I finished
      <p><strong>00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.069 Logan Smilges<strong>: graduate school and move toward the book, I felt a lot more freedom to think a little more expansively
      <p><strong>00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:40.009 Logan Smilges<strong>: about not only the relationship between queerness and silence or sexuality and silence, but also disability, which, of course, is really the primary focus of the book iteration of the project.
      <p><strong>00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.469 Logan Smilges<strong>: And and since queer silence, I have continued to be
      <p><strong>00:03:45.610 --> 00:04:00.909 Logan Smilges<strong>: really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference about coalition, because something that I
      <p><strong>00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.069 Logan Smilgesm<strong>: learned in the process of writing queer silence was that the
      <p><strong>00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:26.159 Logan Smilges<strong>: tension that we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is not. It was one, a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability
      <p><strong>00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.759 Logan Smilges<strong>: on a kind of rhetorical level.
      <p><strong>00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:41.070 Logan Smilges<strong>: But it's also one that has really deep implications, for how queer disabled people understand themselves. How I understand myself.
      <p><strong>00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.760 Logan Smilges<strong>: And so
      <p><strong>00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:52.089 Logan Smilges<strong>: I have continued to write projects, to, to work on projects, including crypt negativity, and some of my
      <p><strong>00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:20.480 Logan Smilges<strong>: work since then that tries to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don't always get along as well as we would like them to
      <p><strong>00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:46.930 David Ornelas<strong>: Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember in reading the 1st chapter or so of crypt negativity. You talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Does bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?
      <p><strong>00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.000 Logan Smilges<strong>: Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated
      <p><strong>00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.940 Logan Smilges<strong>: through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology.
      <p><strong>00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:25.221 Logan Smilges<strong>: There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embodiedness
      <p><strong>00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.640 Logan Smilges<strong>: through and in and in that chapter
      <p><strong>00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:42.730 Logan Smilges<strong>: claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality
      <p><strong>00:06:43.150 --> 00:07:09.400 Logan Smilges<strong>: of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. And I think there are lots of other examples we can
      <p><strong>00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.430 Logan Smilges<strong>: include.
      <p><strong>00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:21.085 Logan Smilges<strong>: I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so
      <p><strong>00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:33.450 Logan Smilges<strong>: I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness
      <p><strong>00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:46.590 Logan Smilges<strong>: that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus
      <p><strong>00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.924 Logan Smilges<strong>: encounter obstacles to gathering in in community.
      <p><strong>00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.749 Logan Smilges<strong>: now that all said, I think
      <p><strong>00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.360 Logan Smilges<strong>: I think there's also a degree to which<p><strong>
      <p><strong>00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:29.659 Logan Smilges<strong>: technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. And in this way, I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like
      <p><strong>00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:42.869 Logan Smilges<strong>: through like technological limbs. But or hearing aids, or also through other forms of assisted communication.
      <p><strong>00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:55.529 Logan Smilges<strong>: that are also kind of technologically robust. So, in these cases, I I back. I would back away a little bit from thinking about
      <p><strong>00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:05.185 Logan Smilges<strong>: technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people,
      <p><strong>00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:25.690 Logan Smilges<strong>: technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Vicea have written a lot about figures of crypt cyborgs that are such good examples of the the real
      <p><strong>00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.410 Logan Smilges<strong>: harmony that can take place between between bodies and technology.
      <p><strong>00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:45.619 David Ornelas<strong>: You and I have been speaking, I think, since like 2021, and my master's thesis at Sdsu was on Grindr, and I heavily resonated with what you wrote about on Chris has especially the chapter on Grindr.
      <p><strong>00:09:45.700 --> 00:10:08.589 David Ornelas<strong>: because what I wrote about my thesis was like the misconceptions that gay men have other gay men while on grinder in this digital space, where you don't know the person, you only see them through their profile picture and the bio they have, and whatever information they've included in that which leads into my next question is through your writing. Do you talk about queer digital spaces? And how do people embody them?
      <p><strong>00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.870 Logan Smilges<strong>: Can. Can you ask that? The the kind of tail end of that question? One more time
      <p><strong>00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.869David Ornelas<strong>: Yes. So through your writing, you talk about current digital spaces, but how do they embody them?
      <p><strong>00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.290 Logan Smilges<strong>: How do people occupy these queer digital spaces?
      <p><strong>00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.060 David Ornelas<strong>: Yes.
      <p><strong>00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.210 Logan Smilges<strong>: Well, there's such a range, right? And I think this is one of the things that can make.
      <p><strong>00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:36.330 Logan Smilges<strong>: Queer digital spaces
      <p><strong>00:10:36.410 --> 00:11:01.849 Logan Smilges<strong>: on the one hand, so promising and enlivening, and also deeply frustrating for people who use them. You know, it's so rare to encounter a queer person who's like I love the apps, the apps make me so happy, you know. I just can't wait to finish my day at work. Sit down and get on the apps like nobody. Nobody says that right.
      <p><strong>00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:24.628 Logan Smilges<strong>: Everyone is upset about the apps. No one likes them, and yet they are so widely popular. Now, I'll be honest with you. I actually have not used like a queer dating app. Since, like 2017, it has been. It's been a long time since I have actively used them myself.
      <p><strong>00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.780 Logan Smilges<strong>: that, said they.
      <p><strong>00:11:29.742 --> 00:11:33.620 Logan Smilges<strong>: They continue to shape
      <p><strong>00:11:33.710 --> 00:12:00.753 Logan Smilges<strong>: my life because of how pervasively they're used in community right? It is increasingly strange for queer people to meet one another, Irl for the 1st time. Right? Even if it's not an app like Grindr, it'll be another app like Instagram or Tiktok, right? Like the like. Social media specifically, has become such a dominant way that
      <p><strong>00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.630 Logan Smilges<strong>: that people meet one another. And so, as a result.
      <p><strong>00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:20.700 Logan Smilges<strong>: people bring lots of different expectations into these queer digital spaces. And I think this is what can often lead to the frustration that people feel
      <p><strong>00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.749 Logan Smilges<strong>: specifically on apps like
      <p><strong>00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:36.300 Logan Smilges<strong>: Grindr jacked tinder. Where the line between a sex app and a dating app can become a little blurry.
      <p><strong>00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:57.479 Logan Smilges<strong>: It can be really not only confusing, but angering for some folks when another person is using the platform in a way that does not align with their own expectations for how they want to use the platform, or how they were hoping others will use the platform. And this.
      <p><strong>00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.590 Logan Smilges<strong>: you know, this is no more clear.
      <p><strong>00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:29.150 Logan Smilges<strong>: This becomes no more evident than when you can read in people's bios their frustrations when they itemize all the things that they do or don't want from others who interact with them. Right? Sometimes they itemize certain physical characteristics, often in like deeply racist and problematic and ableist transphobic ways, but also sometimes they will.
      <p><strong>00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:50.669 Logan Smilges<strong>: They will list expectations that aren't directly or explicitly linked to certain forms of embodiment, but nevertheless set out expectations for how one presents themself visibly, authentically, comprehensively, on the platform. And if this is
      <p><strong>00:13:51.420 --> 00:14:12.569 Logan Smilges<strong>: You know, this starts to get into what I write about in clear silence about the kinds of profile pictures that people include. There's increasingly an expectation that people will show their face that people will be transparent with their whole identity right up front. And when people fail to do that, when a user fails to do that. It can spark lots of feelings
      <p><strong>00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.010 David Ornelas<strong>: Yeah.
      <p><strong>00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:14.640 Logan Smilges<strong>: There is.
      <p><strong>00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:39.378 David Ornelas<strong>: Both you and I know Grindr, I would say, is 99.9 9% a hookup app. But, like you said the way they men on the app, or try and body who they are is maybe not who they really are, but maybe to attract other men. And then I also feel you go to other dating apps, like, for example, hinge, and you have gay men on there. I think the premise of what men are looking for is completely different than what they're seeking on. Grindr.
      <p><strong>00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:49.510 Logan Smilges<strong>: Absolutely well, and I think even when we call an app like Grindr, a hookup app.
      <p><strong>00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.749 Logan Smilges<strong>: what a hookup entails is still so variable, you know, and
      <p><strong>00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:24.280 Logan Smilges<strong>: you know, for example, there are a lot of disabled people whose interest and I guess this isn't even restricted to disabled people. But I'm thinking about disabled folks because of my own kind of community commitments. But for a lot of folks like virtual sex is the most accessible form of sex for them, or for, like, you know, for these folks like
      <p><strong>00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:34.289 Logan Smilges<strong>: a hookup means sexting right, whereas for other users they will complain about endless conversations.
      <p><strong>00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:56.780 Logan Smilges<strong>: Right? It's like, when are we gonna meet? When are we gonna get to the point? Right? So even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, which I'm still not convinced everyone thinks it is, but even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, it still leaves us with so much room for disagreement. And I don't think disagreement is bad at all. What
      <p><strong>00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:05.859 Logan Smilges<strong>: I think the reason that people are so frustrated feel so intensely about difference
      <p><strong>00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:15.360 Logan Smilges<strong>: on kind of or in queer digital spaces is because they they they expect like
      <p><strong>00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:25.790 Logan Smilges<strong>: homogeny, you know, they they expect a kind of universal purpose. For these spaces, which
      <p><strong>00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:31.369 Logan Smilges<strong>: has always been strange to me, because it is so counter to what
      <p><strong>00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:45.599 Logan Smilges<strong>: queers have always been like when we gather. You know, we are always just. We're defined by our difference. So it should make sense that we're not going to be the same among one another. You know
      <p><strong>00:16:46.130 --> 00:17:02.140 David Ornelas<strong>: Yeah. Do you incorporate your own lived experiences from your book or books or questions within your teaching? I don't mean, like not. Do you like directly. Talk about grandeur in your classes. But do you? Do you talk about your own lived experiences in your in your teaching?
      <p><strong>00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:32.370 Logan Smilges<strong>: Yes, when relevant something I really stress to students at all levels is the importance of being able to articulate your position in relation to the topic at hand. Whether this is a conversation we're having, or an essay that we're writing, it's so
      <p><strong>00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.230 Logan Smilges<strong>: essential that we're able to articulate
      <p><strong>00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:50.929 Logan Smilges<strong>: the stakes of the of the topic for us. Right? Why do we care? Why are we interested? Why should we be trusted as an authority about Xyz? And in order to.
      <p><strong>00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.919 Logan Smilges<strong>: in order to state those stakes.
      <p><strong>00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:08.949 Logan Smilges<strong>: I find it very useful to be transparent about my lived experiences, and I like that. You use the phrase, lived experiences rather than just identities. Because.
      <p><strong>00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:21.730 Logan Smilges<strong>: as as I write about pretty regularly, I'm very suspicious of the way that identity is increasingly used as a kind of synecdoche for politics.
      <p><strong>00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:34.730 Logan Smilges<strong>: right? Or used as a synecdote key for authority on a particular topic. And and that's not at all what I want to do when I position myself
      <p><strong>00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.739 David Ornelas<strong>: How do you incorporate diversity and inclusion within your teaching?
      <p><strong>00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.180 Logan Smilges<strong>: Diversity and inclusion.
      <p><strong>00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.650 David Ornelas<strong>: Yeah, within your teaching.
      <p><strong>00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.955 Logan Smilges<strong>: Well,
      <p><strong>00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:50.320 Logan Smilges<strong>: On a couple of different registers one would be
      <p><strong>00:18:50.630 --> 00:19:05.150 Logan Smilges<strong>: curricularly. It's really important to me that my syllabi not only include, but center minoritarian voices.
      <p><strong>00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:17.130 Logan Smilges<strong>: On whatever I'm teaching, I predominantly teach disability studies and trans studies courses. And so within within those
      <p><strong>00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:38.399 Logan Smilges<strong>: courses, I'm not only trying to present, you know, the category of disability or the category of transness as this kind of as these kind of like monolithic silos, but trying to think about trying to think intersectionally about folks who continue to be marginalized even within these communities, and then
      <p><strong>00:19:38.480 --> 00:20:01.039 Logan Smilges<strong>: centering or kind of trying to de-center those folks who consistently occupy most privileged positions within those communities. Right? So in the disability studies course, for instance, it's important to me that I really center indigenous black crip of color voices.
      <p><strong>00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:09.329 Logan Smilges<strong>: because as as you know. Well, if I if any of us
      <p><strong>00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:25.400 Logan Smilges<strong>: do not actively center those margins, then those margins continue to remain obsolete, or continue to remain voiceless in the conversation. So that's that's 1 way that I incorporate it another way, though.
      <p><strong>00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:31.566 Logan Smilges<strong>: pertains more to pedagogical strategies that I use?
      <p><strong>00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:44.820 Logan Smilges<strong>: so I I go to to somewhat great lengths, to design classroom activities that that
      <p><strong>00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:57.451 Logan Smilges<strong>: ask students to do the very work that I was just describing in in response to the last question about positioning themselves in relation to the topic.
      <p><strong>00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:11.680 Logan Smilges<strong>: right now, I'm teaching something of a history of transmedicine course. And I I teach this a version of this course every year, and one of the challenges that
      <p><strong>00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:17.919 Logan Smilges<strong>: appears most regularly is that cisgender students who, just
      <p><strong>00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:28.839 Logan Smilges<strong>: because of demographics, tend to be most of the students in the class. They like don't know how to participate because they feel
      <p><strong>00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:35.269 Logan Smilges<strong>: they feel as though the topic is so distant
      <p><strong>00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.820 Logan Smilges<strong>: from their own lived experience. And so
      <p><strong>00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:47.300 Logan Smilges<strong>: I find it. I find that part of my responsibility as an educator is to really
      <p><strong>00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.600 Logan Smilges<strong>: is to really push students to think about
      <p><strong>00:21:52.720 --> 00:22:09.849 Logan Smilges<strong>: categories like transness as an effect of systems of power rather than just as a kind of innate, essential identity, and so helping students to position themselves within systems of
      <p><strong>00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:18.980 Logan Smilges<strong>: like kind of or position themselves within sex gender systems and be able to be able to help them
      <p><strong>00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:37.649 Logan Smilges<strong>: see their own proximity to power, to articulate their own proximity to power, which, of course, is never a 0 sum kind of game. All of us have kind of shifting proximities to power. That to me is like
      <p><strong>00:22:39.070 --> 00:23:06.439 Logan Smilges<strong>: the go, the goal, the central goal of of teaching, because if students are able to articulate their own position in the world. It is so much easier for them to understand their relationships with others which can help them know when it's when it's time to speak up, when it's time to take a backseat, when it's time to listen and and learn. So
      <p><strong>00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:21.050 Logan Smilges<strong>: I like to think that I'm I'm thinking about diversity and inclusion, maybe not using those words per se, but thinking about the ideas related to diversity and inclusion on both the kind of curricular and pedagogical levels
      <p><strong>00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:32.630 David Ornelas<strong>: You talk a lot about silence within your book. How can educators incorporate the concept of silence as a rhetorical strategy, both in writing and through communication and curricula.
      <p><strong>00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.730 Logan Smilges<strong>: Well, I think
      <p><strong>00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:50.309 Logan Smilges<strong>: writing communication and curricular are kind of like all very different. So silence is going to look different in each of those contexts.
      <p><strong>00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:59.530 Logan Smilges<strong>: but one thing that perhaps links the 3 of them is the fact that
      <p><strong>00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:15.920 Logan Smilges<strong>: I don't understand silence purely as verbal silence, and I certainly don't understand it purely as emptiness. But instead, I think about silence as
      <p><strong>00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.160 Logan Smilges<strong>: as
      <p><strong>00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:41.729 Logan Smilges<strong>: a kind of multimodal absence, or it can appear across various modalities, and I also think about silence as gestural right. So the absence of one modality is always already a gesture toward the presence of another modality. And so
      <p><strong>00:24:44.246 --> 00:24:57.370 Logan Smilges<strong>: across writing, communication and curricula. Then I would really encourage educators to think about how 1st
      <p><strong>00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:13.550 Logan Smilges<strong>: their own silences are being how their own silences can create opportunities for other forms of presence.
      <p><strong>00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:25.759 Logan Smilges<strong>: Right? Just as I was saying before, it's important that students learn when to listen, when to kind of sit down. It's also important, too, I think, for educators to be able to
      <p><strong>00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:35.239 Logan Smilges<strong>: to, not to not feel as though they have to speak on everything all the time, but actually
      <p><strong>00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:47.009 Logan Smilges<strong>: kind of instrumentalize silence as a way of inviting forms of presence from students or or from others.
      <p><strong>00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.839 Logan Smilges<strong>: In my writing I I like to think about
