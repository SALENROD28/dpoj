      <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish I usually tack on the first initial of my first name, J, and my research interests kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Although your *Queer Silence on Disability and Rhetorical Absence* book was really big, how was that like? What was your journey that sparked that? And then going into *Crip Negativity*, and the rest of your books?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, goodness! Well, *Queer Silence*—my first book—was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about half of it was revised from my dissertation, and then I added a couple of chapters, and took out a couple of chapters. The arc of it was there, but it changed a lot. And the journey that started it was truly the process of becoming disabled myself and navigating that through grad school, and all of the mixed messages that I was receiving about disability and about how we talk about disability and about who gets to talk about disability. So all of that kind of played into the questions that I was asking around the body, and representation, and identity and rhetorical scholarship. So those themes just carried through into the book. And then the second book, *Crip Negativity*, was a bit different. I got to be a little more creative with it. I didn't have to follow the same rhetorical studies structure that I felt like I had to with *Queer Silence*. And so with *Crip Negativity*, I wanted to really ask questions about how we represent disability and what kinds of affects are available for thinking about disability. And so I turned to a lot of cultural texts in that book, and that was kind of the crux of it. And then the third book, *A Queer and Transgender History of the United States*, was a different kind of project. That one was more of a popular press book. It was written with the general public in mind. And so the research process and the writing process were very different for that one.</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: And, since queer silence, I have continued to be really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference about coalition, because something that I learned in the process of writing queer silence was that the tension that we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is not what it once was, a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability on a kind of rhetorical level. But it's also one that has really deep implications for how queer disabled people understand themselves. How I understand myself, and so I have continued to write projects, to work on projects, including crip negativity, and some of my work since then that tries to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don't always get along as well as we would like them to.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember reading the 1st chapter or so of Crip Negativity, you talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability and the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Does bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?<p> 
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology. There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embodiedness through and in and in that chapter I claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. I think there are lots of other examples we can include. I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus encounter obstacles to gathering in community now that all said, I think there's also a degree to which technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies, but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. In this way I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like a technological limb or also through other forms of assisted communication that are also kind of technologically robust. So in these cases, I would back away a little bit from thinking about technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people, technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Weise have written a lot about figures of crip cyborgs that are such good examples of the real harmony that can take place between bodies and technology.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> You and I have been speaking, I think, since 2021, and my master's thesis at SDSU was on Grindr, and I heavily resonated with what you wrote about on queer silence, especially the chapter on Grindr because what I wrote about in my thesis was like the misconceptions that gay men have other gay men while on Grindr in this digital space, where you don't know the person, you only see them through their profile picture and the bio they have, and whatever information they've included in that which leads into my next question is through your writing, do you talk about queer digital spaces? And how do people embody them?<p>
        
      <p>Logan Smilges: Can you ask that? The kind of tail end of that question? One more time.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yes. So through your writing, you talk about current digital spaces, but how do queer people embody them?<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: How do people occupy these queer digital spaces?<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yes.<p>
                                            
      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, there's such a range, right? And I think this is one of the things that can make queer digital spaces on the one hand, so promising and enlivening, and also deeply frustrating for people who use them. You know, it's so rare to encounter a queer person who's like I love the apps, the apps make me so happy, you know. I just can't wait to finish my day at work, sit down and get on the apps like nobody says that right. Everyone is upset about the apps. No one likes them, and yet they are so widely popular. Now, I'll be honest with you, I actually have not used a queer dating app since, like 2017, It's been a long time since I have actively used them myself. They continue to shape my life because of how pervasively they're used in community right? It is increasingly strange for queer people to meet one another, in real life for the 1st time. Right? Even if it's not an app like Grindr, it'll be another app like Instagram or Tiktok, right? Like social media, specifically, has become such a dominant way that people meet one another, and so, as a result people bring lots of different expectations into these queer digital spaces, and I think this is what can often lead to the frustration that people feel specifically on apps like, Grindr, Jack’d, and Tinder, where the line between a sex app and a dating app can become a little blurry. It can be really not only confuse, but angering for some folks when another person is using the platform in a way that does not align with their own expectations for how they want to use the platform, or how they were hoping others will use the platform. And this you know, this is no more clear.<p>
        
      <p>Logan Smilges: This becomes no more evident than when you can read in people's bios their frustrations when they itemize all the things that they do or don't want from others who interact with them. Right? Sometimes they itemize certain physical characteristics, often in deeply racist and problematic and ableist transphobic ways.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: They will list expectations that aren't directly or explicitly linked to certain forms of embodiment, but nevertheless set out expectations for how one presents themself visibly, authentically, comprehensively, on the platform,and if this is you know, this starts to get into what I write about in queer silence about the kinds of profile pictures that people include. There's increasingly an expectation that people will show their face that people will be transparent with their whole identity right up front, and when people fail to do that, when a user fails to do that, it can spark lots of feelings<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yeah.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: There is.<p> 
        
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Both you and I know Grindr, I would say, is 99.9% a hookup app, but, like you said the way they men on the app, or try and body who they are is maybe not who they really are, but maybe to attract other men. Then I also feel you go to other dating apps, like, for example, Hinge, and you have gay men on there. I think the premise of what men are looking for is completely different than what they're seeking on Grindr.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Absolutely. Well, and I think even when we call an app like Grindr, a hookup app. What a hookup entails is still so variable, you know for example, there are a lot of disabled people whose interest and I guess this isn't even restricted to disabled people, but I'm thinking about disabled folks because of my own kind of community commitments. But for a lot of folks like virtual sex is the most accessible form of sex for them, or for, like, you know, for these folks like a hookup means sexting right, whereas for other users they will complain about endless conversations. Right? It's like, when are we gonna meet? When are we gonna get to the point? Right? So even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, which I'm still not convinced everyone thinks it is, but even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, it still leaves us with so much room for disagreement, and I don't think disagreement is bad at all.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: I think the reason that people are so frustrated and feel so intensely about differences on kind of or in queer digital spaces is because they expect homogeny, you know, they expect a kind of universal purpose. For these spaces, which has always been strange to me, because it is so counter to what queers have always been like when we gather. You know, we are always just defined by our differences. So it should make sense that we're not going to be the same among one another. <p>
        
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Do you incorporate your own lived experiences from your book or books or questions within your teaching? I don't mean, do you directly talk about Grindr in your classes. But do you? Do you talk about your own lived experiences in your teaching?<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Yes, when relevant something I really stress to students at all levels is the importance of being able to articulate your position in relation to the topic at hand. Whether this is a conversation we're having, or an essay that we're writing, it's so essential that we're able to articulate the stakes of the topic for us. Right? Why do we care? Why are we interested? Why should we be trusted as an authority about Xyz? And in order to state those stakes, I find it very useful to be transparent about my lived experiences, and I like that. You use the phrase, lived experiences rather than just identities because as I write pretty regularly, I'm very suspicious of the way that identity is increasingly used as a kind of synecdoche for politics, right? or used as a synecdoche key for authority on a particular topic, and that's not at all what I want to do when I position myself.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> How do you incorporate diversity and inclusion within your teaching?<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Diversity and inclusion.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yeah, within your teaching.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, On a couple of different registers one would be curriculum. It's really important to me that my syllabi not only include, but center minoritarian voices on whatever I'm teaching, I predominantly teach disability studies and trans studies courses. And so within those courses, I'm not only trying to present, you know, the category of disability or the category of transness as this kind of as these kind of like monolithic silos, but trying to think about trying to think intersectionally about folks who continue to be marginalized even within these communities, and then centering or kind of trying to de-center those folks who consistently occupy most privileged positions within those communities. Right? So in the disability studies course, for instance, it's important to me that I really center indigenous black crip of color voices  because as you know, well, if any of us do not actively center those margins, then those margins continue to remain obsolete, or continue to remain voiceless in the conversation. So that's one way that I incorporate it another way, though it pertains more to pedagogical strategies that I use. I go to somewhat great lengths to design classroom activities that ask students to do the very work that I was just describing in response to the last question about positioning themselves in relation to the topic. Right now, I'm teaching a history of trans medicine course, and I teach a version of this course every year, and one of the challenges that appears most regularly is that cisgender students who, just because of demographics, tend to be most of the students in the class. They don't know how to participate because they feel as though the topic is so distant from their own lived experience, and so I find that part of my responsibility as an educator is to really is to really push students to think about.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Categories like transness as an effect of systems of power rather than just as a kind of innate, essential identity, and so helping students to position themselves within systems of like kind of or position themselves within sex gender systems and to be able to help them see their own proximity to power, to articulate their own proximity to power. All of us have kind of shifting proximities to power that to me is like the goal, the central goal of teaching, because if students are able to articulate their own position in the world. It is so much easier for them to understand their relationships with others which can help them know when it's time to speak up, when it's time to take a backseat, when it's time to listen and learn.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: So, I like to think that I'm thinking about diversity and inclusion, maybe not using those words per se, but thinking about the ideas related to diversity and inclusion on both the kind of curricular and pedagogical levels.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> You talk a lot about silence within your book. How can educators incorporate the concept of silence as a rhetorical strategy, both in writing and through communication and curricula?<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, I think writing communication and curricular are kind of like all very different. So silence is going to look different in each of those contexts but one thing that perhaps links the 3 of them is the fact that I don't understand silence purely as verbal silence, and I certainly don't understand it purely as emptiness. But instead, I think about silence as a kind of multimodal absence, or it can appear across various modalities, and I also think about silence as a gestural right. So the absence of one modality is always already a gesture toward the presence of another modality, and so across writing, communication and curricula. Then I would really encourage educators to think about how 1st their own silences are being and how their own silences can create opportunities for other forms of presence.<p> 

      <p>Logan Smilges: Right? Just as I was saying before, it's important that students learn when to listen, when to kind of sit down. It's also important, I think, for educators to be able to not feel as though they have to speak on everything all the time, but actually kind of instrumentalize silence as a way of inviting forms of presence from students or from others. In my writing I like to think about silence with regard to my citation. Politics you know. There are times when citation is such a beautiful way of not only amplifying voices but it's also a way of acknowledging our own authorial limits and saying things like this actually isn't a topic that I feel as though I have the authority to like to speak on by myself, and so I'm going to intentionally engage with citation as a way to bring in people who are experts or people who do have certain experiences so that they can like, kind of take on that role. But yeah but again trying to create something of a thorough line between writing communication and curricula.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: I think it's really useful to emphasize Silence's multimodality.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> I love that you don't just center it on just like you said at the beginning of it, just being silenced. It's much more than that especially in academia, and you use that example of some students just sitting back and maybe just listening and speaking up when they feel you know they want to contribute and stuff like that. But I appreciate you saying the silence is beyond just being quiet in space.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Shifting a little bit to online writing spaces. People do engage in silent discourse with that being said, does this complicate our understanding of identity and rhetorical silence in digital spaces?<p>
        
      <p>Logan Smilges: Could I ask you to expand a little bit on what you mean by silent discourse?<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yes, so I think I'm kind of referring also to again what you just said about silence within the classroom from cisgender students who maybe like not that they don't relate to the curriculum being taught, but they just feel like there's a distance between them and the curriculum in the class. So the silent discourse. That's kind of what I'm referring to.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Okay. So folks who are participating in the discourse through their silence.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yeah.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Yeah.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Okay.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: I mean, I think one of the more challenging reasons that this question is challenging is that silence can mean so many different things right? Especially when it's coming from students. Some students are going to be silent because they've learned what we want them to learn, which is that it's okay to not speak right, and they're intentionally engaging in silence as a way of allowing others to speak. And that's great but there are other times when students engage in silence, because  it comes from a place of discomfort when it comes from a place of insecurity. It comes from a place of perceived deficit where they don't feel they don't feel empowered to speak. They don't feel like they would be listened to, or maybe they're even afraid of forms of retribution or response, were they to speak? And so I think it's very important to always take silence in context.<p>
        
      <p>Logan Smilges: It can be really dangerous, actually, to form universal theories of what silence means, and this is one of the critiques that I offer in queer silence of how a lot of the history of queer activism has been predicated on rather universal theories of silence as a bad thing.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: But of course, that assumption does a lot of real damage to the multiplicity of silences. You asked specifically about online writing spaces. Were you thinking about social media?<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yes, of course, and just online work that's done that students have to do like for classic discussion boards or peer reviews, stuff like that.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, my goodness! Well, what comes to mind with those examples? Like such as a discussion board? This is a great way to think about silence, not only as a kind of verbal absence, but as a kind of more multimodal gestural phenomenon, because, as every teacher who has taught online is familiar. There are many students who will use a lot of words to say absolutely nothing right? And this becomes all the more common when, as when AI increasingly becomes commonplace. In students, composition practices and, and so, while these forms of discoursing are not silent in the sense that they're absent. They do engage a kind of silence in so far as they withhold a lot of depth. They withhold forms of engagement that we're hoping for from our students. And once again, I think that withholding can mean a lot of different things. Sometimes, of course, students just don't want to do the work that's not unique to students. All of us don't want to do our work sometimes, so I don't want to blame students too much for that.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: But is the case? Sometimes students don't want to do the work other times. Other times, students have other priorities, you know, or similar to in class. They're not convinced that, you know, pouring their heart into a response is going to offer them much good, you know, and I think we can learn a lot from students' forms of disengagement online. I think maybe disengagement is a nice kind of corollary to silence because it can teach us as educators how our students are perceiving the work that we've assigned them the value that they see in that work. And sometimes students just need to explain why certain work is important to do. Other times, I think, students here can really get onto something that what we assign them to do is perhaps not as useful to them as we would like to think it is and I think attending to their silences can be a really good kind of metric for us in that regard.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Thank you. Staying on the topic of digital communication. Early on in our interview I did talk about how I wrote about Grindr in my thesis at SDSU, and I focused on the ideal body of a gay man? How must they achieve love through the app? How do you see digital communication platforms like Grindr, influencing the role of silence in queer and disabled rhetorics? To elaborate because we talked early on about how Grindr is well known for a hookup app, and it may be like the misconception from other people like, well, you know, I found love on here, but others saying, you know it's just easy to meet with a guy within your area, and simple as that but do you feel that influences the role of science and queer and disabled rhetorics?<p>
        
      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, I think that apps like Grindr are a form of a platform on which communication takes place. It provides certain conditions that structure the kind of silence that is possible. So, for example Grindr makes it possible for some queer people to engage in visual or embodied silences that they could not engage through other forms of communication, particularly those that are in real life. Right? So there there are some ways in which Grindr makes more silence more possible but there are other ways in which digital communication platforms, like Grindr can also restrict people's capacity for silence and I think this a good example of this is folks who, because they choose to engage in a kind of visual silence or embodied silence they find it much more difficult to like, interact with other users on the app right. They are verbally silenced because no one responds to their messages, and I think that kind of that kind of silencing is not necessarily unique to the platform, because that also can occur in real life where people just don't respond to you. It is nevertheless conditioned by the app.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: I guess. What I'm trying to say is that I try to resist thinking about a single form of communication, as either like good or bad, for silence, and more so, simply altering the forms of absence that are possible you know, in a, or in a gay bar, there are forms of silence that people can engage there, too, that are not possible on on an app, you know, and these one example that comes to mind for me is folks who are verbally silent, but are still dancing with people and like making physical contact, and like making out and like, there are forms of embodied presence in person that require absolutely zero verbal communication, whereas on an app like Grindr there's always a verbal foreplay.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Right? You gotta set it up. And so yeah, I like that. Your question uses the word influence like, how does it? How do these platforms influence silence rather than simply create or constrain?<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> No, I really like that example, because, like you said, you're in a club, and you're seeing someone in real life on Grindr or you're talking to, you know, sometimes a blank profile. You don't even know who you're talking to and like you said early on that in itself is a form of talking amongst gays. So I really like that.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Thank you. As our last question. how do you see your work, present and future, intersecting with emerging fields within fields, like digital humanities.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, goodness! I was afraid you were going to ask me this one. Well, I don't know if that's good or bad. The reason I was afraid is because I'm not entirely certain. I know what the digital humanities refer to, I think that I am, I continue to be interested in the myriad ways that people find that that people adopt in order to stay together and increasingly, in this kind of ongoing pandemic world. Where, or forms of fascism are kind of spreading globally in terrifyingly quick ways. Technology is a dominant way for people to stick together, for people to stay together And so I find myself spending increasing amounts of time really studying and thinking about what certain digital platforms make possible and what they constrict or constrain, you know. Just as I was saying with regard to your last question about the role of silence on these platforms, and something I've been trying to really work through in my head recently is the, what seems to be a kind of shifting era in the world of social media where a lot of the platforms that digital communities have grown accustomed to using in the last decade are being abandoned. Platforms like Facebook platforms like Twitter, potentially, platforms like Tiktok, which continue to be legislated and in ways that make their use very unreliable, you know.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: and it's also the case that in a lot of countries, platforms like Grindr are being heavily surveilled in ways that make them unusable for queer people. So I'm feeling as though we're in a really interesting moment where the way people are engaging technology to stay together is changing, and so, even though I don't feel as though I'm prepared to comment on the quality or form of those changes, I do think it is an ongoing interest of mine.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: I think it's also worth noting, too, that an increasing number of young people are not using social media at all. You know they've grown up with millennial parents who were always on their phones.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yeah.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: And, you know, have decided to adopt a kind of aesthetic that for very good reasons, just does not engage communication technologies in the same way. So I can't say for certain how my work is going to take up these changes.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Admittedly, the book projects I'm working on now are not connected to these changes, but I can assure you there are things that I'm aware of and thinking about, and and will likely write about in the future.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Awesome. Thank you so much for your time. Dr. Smilges.</p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Of course I hope that my answers were helpful to you.</p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> They were.</p>
