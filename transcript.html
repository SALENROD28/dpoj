      <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish I usually tack on the first initial of my first name, J, and my research interests kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Although your *Queer Silence on Disability and Rhetorical Absence* book was really big, how was that like? What was your journey that sparked that? And then going into *Crip Negativity*, and the rest of your books?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, goodness! Well, *Queer Silence*—my first book—was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about half of it was revised from my dissertation, and then I added a couple of chapters, and took out a couple of chapters. The arc of it was there, but it changed a lot. And the journey that started it was truly the process of becoming disabled myself and navigating that through grad school, and all of the mixed messages that I was receiving about disability and about how we talk about disability and about who gets to talk about disability. So all of that kind of played into the questions that I was asking around the body, and representation, and identity and rhetorical scholarship. So those themes just carried through into the book. And then the second book, *Crip Negativity*, was a bit different. I got to be a little more creative with it. I didn't have to follow the same rhetorical studies structure that I felt like I had to with *Queer Silence*. And so with *Crip Negativity*, I wanted to really ask questions about how we represent disability and what kinds of affects are available for thinking about disability. And so I turned to a lot of cultural texts in that book, and that was kind of the crux of it. And then the third book, *A Queer and Transgender History of the United States*, was a different kind of project. That one was more of a popular press book. It was written with the general public in mind. And so the research process and the writing process were very different for that one.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> And would you say there’s a different audience for each of your books?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Yeah, totally. With *Queer Silence*, the audience was definitely the field. I was writing for other scholars in rhetorical studies, disability studies, and queer and trans studies. And with *Crip Negativity*, I was also writing for that same audience, but I was also trying to push the field a little bit. I was trying to ask the field to be a little more creative, to think outside the box, to think differently about how we approach our objects of study. And then with *A Queer and Transgender History of the United States*, I was really thinking about young queer and trans people who are just coming into their identities and are looking for some kind of historical grounding or affirmation. So yeah, very different audiences.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> What are you hoping students and scholars take away from your work?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, that’s a great question. I think what I hope people take away is a sense of expansiveness—that there’s not one right way to be disabled, there’s not one right way to be queer or trans, and there’s not one right way to write about or talk about those experiences. I hope that my work gives people permission to explore their own ways of expressing and embodying those identities.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> That was great! Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Smilges.</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Thank you! It was a pleasure to talk with you.</p>
