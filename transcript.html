      <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>
      
      <p><strong>00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.629</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:</strong> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests.</p>
      <p><strong>00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:28.340</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish, I usually tack on the 1st initial of my 1st name Jay, and my research interestâ€™s kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</p>
      <p><strong>00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.579</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Although your career science on disability and rhetorical absence book was big, how did that like? What was your journey that sparked that? And then going into crypt negativity, and the rest of your books.</p>
      <p><strong>00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.876</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Oh, goodness! Well,
      <p><strong>00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:59.230</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> queer silence! My 1st book was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about 50% of my dissertation found its way into the book.
      <p><strong>00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:17.280</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> and I note that because my dissertation was very much the culmination of a series of questions that led me to grad school. To begin with, I spent a good deal of my adolescence in conversion therapy
      <p><strong>00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.520</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> which
      <p><strong>00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:42.799</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> offered me a deeply harmful but nevertheless comprehensive framework to think about the relationship between sexuality and disability, and after finishing and in many ways surviving conversion therapy, I was left with a lot of questions about about that relationship
      <p><strong>00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:59.540</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> between well, my own experience of sexuality and disability, notwithstanding the disabilities I have that are somewhat independent, or not necessarily as intimately connected to my sexuality. And so
      <p><strong>00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.340</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> I entered grad school, really wanting to understand better what I experienced and how the language that we must talk about disability and sexuality, particularly in relation.
      <p><strong>00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.890</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> can shape what people experience on an embodied level of these kinds of identities.
      <p><strong>00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.652</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> And so queer silence.
      <p><strong>00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:47.369</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Was an attempt to answer a lot of those questions. And in the dissertation the kind of 1st iteration of that project I was really primarily focused on sexuality and thinking about how people
      <p><strong>00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.579</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> within sexual minorities
      <p><strong>00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:12.480</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> have to drum up strategies to survive that don't always seem or register to others as particularly radical or resilient but nevertheless are highly effective at keeping people alive or keeping people safe. And then.
      <p><strong>00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.669</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> when I I finished
      <p><strong>00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.069</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> graduate school and move toward the book, I felt a lot more freedom to think a little more expansively
      <p><strong>00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:40.009</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> about not only the relationship between queerness and silence or sexuality and silence, but also disability, which, of course, is really the primary focus of the book iteration of the project.
      <p><strong>00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.469</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> And and since queer silence, I have continued to be
      <p><strong>00:03:45.610 --> 00:04:00.909</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference about coalition, because something that I
      <p><strong>00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.069</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> learned in the process of writing queer silence was that the
      <p><strong>00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:26.159</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> tension that we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is not. It was one, a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability
      <p><strong>00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.759</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> on a kind of rhetorical level.
      <p><strong>00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:41.070</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> But it's also one that has really deep implications, for how queer disabled people understand themselves. How I understand myself.
      <p><strong>00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.760</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> And so
      <p><strong>00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:52.089</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> I have continued to write projects, to, to work on projects, including crypt negativity, and some of my
      <p><strong>00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:20.480</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> work since then that tries to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don't always get along as well as we would like them to
      <p><strong>00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:46.930</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember in reading the 1st chapter or so of crypt negativity. You talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Do bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?
      <p><strong>00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.000</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated
      <p><strong>00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.940</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology.
      <p><strong>00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:25.221</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embeddedness
      <p><strong>00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.640</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> through and in and in that chapter
      <p><strong>00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:42.730</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality
      <p><strong>00:06:43.150 --> 00:07:09.400</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. And I think there are lots of other examples we can
      <p><strong>00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.430</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> include.
      <p><strong>00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:21.085</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so
      <p><strong>00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:33.450</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness
      <p><strong>00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:46.590</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus
      <p><strong>00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.924</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> encounter obstacles to gathering in in community.
      <p><strong>00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.749</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> now that all said, I think
      <p><strong>00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.360</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> I think there's also a degree to which<p><strong>
      <p><strong>00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:29.659</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. And in this way, I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like
      <p><strong>00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:42.869</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> through like technological limbs. But or hearing aids, or also through other forms of assisted communication.
      <p><strong>00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:55.529</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> that are also kind of technologically robust. So, in these cases, I back. I would back away a little bit from thinking about
      <p><strong>00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:05.185</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people,
      <p><strong>00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:25.690</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Vicea have written a lot about figures of crypt cyborgs that are such good examples of the real
      <p><strong>00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.410</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> harmony that can take place between bodies and technology.
      <p><strong>00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:45.619</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:</strong>strong> You and I have been speaking, I think, since like 2021, and my master's thesis at SDSU was on Grindr, and I heavily resonated with what you wrote about on Chris has especially the chapter on Grindr.
      <p><strong>00:09:45.700 --> 00:10:08.589</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:</strong>strong> because what I wrote about my thesis was like the misconceptions that gay men have other gay men while on grinder in this digital space, where you don't know the person, you only see them through their profile picture and the bio they have, and whatever information they've included in that which leads into my next question is through your writing. Do you talk about queer digital spaces? And how do people embody them?
      <p><strong>00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.870</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> Can. Can you ask that? The the kind of tail end of that question? One more time
      <p><strong>00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.869</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:</strong>strong> Yes. So, through your writing, you talk about current digital spaces, but how do they embody them?
      <p><strong>00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.290</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> How do people occupy these queer digital spaces?
      <p><strong>00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.060</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:</strong>strong> Yes.
      <p><strong>00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.210</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> Well, there's such a range, right? And I think this is one of the things that can make.
      <p><strong>00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:36.330</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> Queer digital spaces
      <p><strong>00:10:36.410 --> 00:11:01.849</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> on the one hand, so promising and enlivening, and also deeply frustrating for people who use them. You know, it's so rare to encounter a queer person who's like I love the apps, the apps make me so happy, you know. I just can't wait to finish my day at work. Sit down and get on the apps like nobody. Nobody says that right.
      <p><strong>00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:24.628</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> Everyone is upset about the apps. No one likes them, and yet they are so widely popular. Now, I'll be honest with you. I actually have not used like a queer dating app. Since, like 2017, it has been. It's been a long time since I have actively used them myself.
      <p><strong>00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.780</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> that, said they.
      <p><strong>00:11:29.742 --> 00:11:33.620</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:</strong>strong> They continue to shape
      <p><strong>00:11:33.710 --> 00:12:00.753</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> my life because of how pervasively they're used in community right? It is increasingly strange for queer people to meet one another, Irl for the 1st time. Right? Even if it's not an app like Grindr, it'll be another app like Instagram or Tiktok, right? Like the like. Social media specifically, has become such a dominant way that
      <p><strong>00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.630</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> that people meet one another. And so, as a result.
      <p><strong>00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:20.700</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> people bring lots of different expectations into these queer digital spaces. And I think this is what can often lead to the frustration that people feel
      <p><strong>00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.749</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> specifically on apps like
      <p><strong>00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:36.300</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Grindr jacked tinder. Where the line between a sex app and a dating app can become a little blurry.
      <p><strong>00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:57.479</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> It can be really not only confusing, but angering for some folks when another person is using the platform in a way that does not align with their own expectations for how they want to use the platform, or how they were hoping others will use the platform. And this.
      <p><strong>00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.590</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> you know, this is no more clear.
      <p><strong>00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:29.150</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> This becomes no more evident than when you can read in people's bios their frustrations when they itemize all the things that they do or don't want from others who interact with them. Right? Sometimes they itemize certain physical characteristics, often in like deeply racist and problematic and ableist transphobic ways, but also sometimes they will.
      <p><strong>00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:50.669</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> They will list expectations that aren't directly or explicitly linked to certain forms of embodiment but nevertheless set out expectations for how one presents themself visibly, authentically, comprehensively, on the platform. And if this is
      <p><strong>00:13:51.420 --> 00:14:12.569</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> You know, this starts to get into what I write about in clear silence about the kinds of profile pictures that people include. There's increasingly an expectation that people will show their face that people will be transparent with their whole identity right up front. And when people fail to do that, when a user fails to do that. It can spark lots of feelings
      <p><strong>00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.010</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Yeah.
      <p><strong>00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:14.640</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> There is.
      <p><strong>00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:39.378</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Both you and I know Grindr, I would say, is 99.9% a hookup app. But, like you said the way they men on the app or try and body who they are is maybe not who they really are, but maybe to attract other men. And then I also feel you go to other dating apps, like, for example, hinge, and you have gay men on there. I think the premise of what men are looking for is completely different than what they're seeking on. Grindr.
      <p><strong>00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:49.510</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Absolutely well, and I think even when we call an app like Grindr, a hookup app.
      <p><strong>00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.749</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> what a hookup entails is still so variable, you know, and
      <p><strong>00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:24.280</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> you know, for example, there are a lot of disabled people whose interest and I guess this isn't even restricted to disabled people. But I'm thinking about disabled folks because of my own kind of community commitments. But for a lot of folks like virtual sex is the most accessible form of sex for them, or for, like, you know, for these folks like
      <p><strong>00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:34.289</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> a hookup means sexting right, whereas for other users they will complain about endless conversations.
      <p><strong>00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:56.780</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Right? It's like, when are we gonna meet? When are we gonna get to the point? Right? So even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, which I'm still not convinced everyone thinks it is, but even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, it still leaves us with so much room for disagreement. And I don't think disagreement is bad at all. What
      <p><strong>00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:05.859</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I think the reason that people are so frustrated feel so intensely about difference
      <p><strong>00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:15.360</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> on kind of or in queer digital spaces is because they expect like
      <p><strong>00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:25.790</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> homogeny, you know, they expect a kind of universal purpose. For these spaces, which
      <p><strong>00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:31.369</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> has always been strange to me, because it is so counter to what
      <p><strong>00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:45.599</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> queers have always been like when we gather. You know, we are always just. We're defined by our difference. So, it should make sense that we're not going to be the same among one another. You know
      <p><strong>00:16:46.130 --> 00:17:02.140</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Yeah. Do you incorporate your own lived experiences from your book or books or questions within your teaching? I don't mean, like not. Do you like directly. Talk about grandeur in your classes. But do you? Do you talk about your own lived experiences in your in your teaching?
      <p><strong>00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:32.370</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Yes, when relevant something I really stress to students at all levels is the importance of being able to articulate your position in relation to the topic at hand. Whether this is a conversation we're having, or an essay that we're writing, it's so
      <p><strong>00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.230</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> essential that we're able to articulate
      <p><strong>00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:50.929</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> the stakes of the of the topic for us. Right? Why do we care? Why are we interested? Why should we be trusted as an authority about Xyz? And in order to.
      <p><strong>00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.919</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> in order to state those stakes.
      <p><strong>00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:08.949</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I find it very useful to be transparent about my lived experiences, and I like that. You use the phrase, lived experiences rather than just identities. Because.
      <p><strong>00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:21.730</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> as as I write about pretty regularly, I'm very suspicious of the way that identity is increasingly used as a kind of synecdoche for politics.
      <p><strong>00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:34.730</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> right? Or used as a synecdote key for authority on a particular topic. And and that's not at all what I want to do when I position myself
      <p><strong>00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.739</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> How do you incorporate diversity and inclusion within your teaching?
      <p><strong>00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.180</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Diversity and inclusion.
      <p><strong>00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.650</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Yeah, within your teaching.
      <p><strong>00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.955</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Well,
      <p><strong>00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:50.320</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> On a couple of different registers, one would be
      <p><strong>00:18:50.630 --> 00:19:05.150</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> curricularly. It's really important to me that my syllabi not only include, but center minoritarian voices.
      <p><strong>00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:17.130</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> On whatever I'm teaching, I predominantly teach disability studies and trans studies courses. And so within within those
      <p><strong>00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:38.399</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> courses, I'm not only trying to present, you know, the category of disability or the category of transness as this kind of as these kind of like monolithic silos, but trying to think about trying to think intersectionally about folks who continue to be marginalized even within these communities, and then
      <p><strong>00:19:38.480 --> 00:20:01.039</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> centering or kind of trying to de-center those folks who consistently occupy most privileged positions within those communities. Right? So, in the disability studies course, for instance, it's important to me that I really center indigenous black crip of color voices.
      <p><strong>00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:09.329</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> because as as you know. Well, if I if any of us
      <p><strong>00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:25.400</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> do not actively center those margins, then those margins continue to remain obsolete, or continue to remain voiceless in the conversation. So that's 1 way that I incorporate it another way, though.
      <p><strong>00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:31.566</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> pertains more to pedagogical strategies that I use?
      <p><strong>00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:44.820</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> so I I go to to somewhat great lengths, to design classroom activities that that
      <p><strong>00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:57.451</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> ask students to do the very work that I was just describing in in response to the last question about positioning themselves in relation to the topic.
      <p><strong>00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:11.680</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> right now, I'm teaching something of a history of transmedicine course. And I I teach this a version of this course every year, and one of the challenges that
      <p><strong>00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:17.919</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> appears most regularly is that cisgender students who, just
      <p><strong>00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:28.839</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> because of demographics, tend to be most of the students in the class. They like don't know how to participate because they feel
      <p><strong>00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:35.269</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> they feel as though the topic is so distant
      <p><strong>00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.820</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> from their own lived experience. And so
      <p><strong>00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:47.300</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I find it. I find that part of my responsibility as an educator is to really
      <p><strong>00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.600</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> is to really push students to think about
      <p><strong>00:21:52.720 --> 00:22:09.849</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> categories like transness as an effect of systems of power rather than just as a kind of innate, essential identity, and so helping students to position themselves within systems of
      <p><strong>00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:18.980</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> like kind of or position themselves within sex gender systems and be able to be able to help them
      <p><strong>00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:37.649</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> see their own proximity to power, to articulate their own proximity to power, which, of course, is never a 0 sum kind of game. All of us have kind of shifting proximities to power. That to me is like
      <p><strong>00:22:39.070 --> 00:23:06.439</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> the go, the goal, the central goal of of teaching, because if students are able to articulate their own position in the world. It is so much easier for them to understand their relationships with others which can help them know when it's when it's time to speak up, when it's time to take a backseat, when it's time to listen and and learn. So
      <p><strong>00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:21.050</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I like to think that I'm thinking about diversity and inclusion, maybe not using those words per se, but thinking about the ideas related to diversity and inclusion on both the kind of curricular and pedagogical levels
      <p><strong>00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:32.630</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> You talk a lot about silence within your book. How can educators incorporate the concept of silence as a rhetorical strategy, both in writing and through communication and curricula.
      <p><strong>00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.730</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Well, I think
      <p><strong>00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:50.309</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> writing communication and curricular are kind of like all very different. So, silence is going to look different in each of those contexts.
      <p><strong>00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:59.530</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> but one thing that perhaps links the 3 of them is the fact that
      <p><strong>00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:15.920</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I don't understand silence purely as verbal silence, and I certainly don't understand it purely as emptiness. But instead, I think about silence as
      <p><strong>00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.160</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> as
      <p><strong>00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:41.729</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> a kind of multimodal absence, or it can appear across various modalities, and I also think about silence as gestural right. So, the absence of one modality is always already a gesture toward the presence of another modality. And so
      <p><strong>00:24:44.246 --> 00:24:57.370</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> across writing, communication and curricula. Then I would really encourage educators to think about how 1st
      <p><strong>00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:13.550</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> their own silences are being how their own silences can create opportunities for other forms of presence.
      <p><strong>00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:25.759</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Right? Just as I was saying before, it's important that students learn when to listen, when to kind of sit down. It's also important, too, I think, for educators to be able to
      <p><strong>00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:35.239</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> to, not to not feel as though they have to speak on everything all the time, but actually
      <p><strong>00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:47.009</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> kind of instrumentalize silence as a way of inviting forms of presence from students or or from others.
      <p><strong>00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.839</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> In my writing I I like to think about
      <p><strong>00:25:52.516 --> 00:25:56.339</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> silence with regard to my citation. Politics.
      <p><strong>00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.295</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> you know. There are times when
      <p><strong>00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:13.700</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> citation is such a beautiful way of not only like amplifying voices. But it's also a way of acknowledging our own authorial limits
      <p><strong>00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:34.059</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> and say like this actually isn't a topic that I feel as though I have the authority to like to speak on by myself. And so I'm going to intentionally engage with citation as a way to bring in people who are experts or people who are who do have certain experiences so that they can
      <p><strong>00:26:34.828 --> 00:26:37.550</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> like, kind of take on that role.
      <p><strong>00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:46.010</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> But yeah, but it. But again, trying to
      <p><strong>00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.089</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> create something of a through line between writing communication and curricula.
      <p><strong>00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:57.839</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I think it's really useful to emphasize Silence's multimodality
      <p><strong>00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:04.219</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> I love that you don't just center it on just like you said at the beginning of it, just being silenced like. It's much more than that.
      <p><strong>00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.490</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> especially in academia. And you use that example of some students just sitting back and maybe just listening
      <p><strong>00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:19.299</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> and speaking up when they feel you know they want to contribute and stuff like that. But I appreciate you saying the silence is beyond just being quiet in space.
      <p><strong>00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:34.480</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Shifting a little bit to online writing spaces. People do engage in silent discourse with that being said, does this complicate our understanding of identity and rhetorical silence in digital spaces
      <p><strong>00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:42.059</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Could I? Could I ask you to to expand a little bit on what you mean by silent discourse?
      <p><strong>00:27:42.560 --> 00:28:00.850</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Yes, so I think I'm kind of referring also to again what you just said about silence within the classroom from cisgender students who maybe like not that they don't relate to the curriculum being taught, but they just feel like there's a distance between them and the curriculum in the class. So the silent discourse. That's kind of what I'm referring to.
      <p><strong>00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.739</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Okay. So, folks who are participating in the discourse through their silence
      <p><strong>00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.300</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Yeah.
      <p><strong>00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.590</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Yeah.
      <p><strong>00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.200</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Okay.
      <p><strong>00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:34.320</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I mean, I think one of the one of the more challenging one of the reasons that this question is challenging is that silence can mean so many different things, right? Especially when it's coming from students. Some students are going to be silent because they've learned what we want them to learn, which is that it's okay to not speak
      <p><strong>00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:49.110</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> right. And they're intentionally engaging silence as a way of allowing others to speak. And that's great but there are other times when students engage silence, because they, because it comes from a place
      <p><strong>00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.099</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> of of discomfort
      <p><strong>00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:15.740</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> when it comes from a place of insecurity. It comes from a place of perceived deficit where they don't feel they don't feel empowered to speak. They don't feel like they would be listened listened to, or maybe they're even afraid of forms of retribution or response, were they to speak? And so I think
      <p><strong>00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:27.390</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> it's very important to always take silence in context.
      <p><strong>00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:29.420</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> It.
      <p><strong>00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:53.159</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> It can be really dangerous, actually, to form kind of universal theories of what silence means. And this is one of the critiques that I offer in queer silence of how a lot of the history of queer activism has been predicated on rather universal theories of silence as a bad thing.
      <p><strong>00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:03.760</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> But of course, that that assumption does a lot of real damage to the multiplicity of silences.
      <p><strong>00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:14.820</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> You asked specifically about online writing spaces. Were you thinking about like social media
      <p><strong>00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:24.679</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> That. Yes, of course. And just online work that's done that students have to do like for classic discussion boards or peer reviews, stuff like that
      <p><strong>00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.340</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Oh, my goodness! Well, what comes to mind
      <p><strong>00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.732</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> with those examples? Like such a such as a discussion board?
      <p><strong>00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:58.040</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> This is a great way to think about silence, not only as a kind of verbal absence, but as a kind of more multimodal gestural phenomenon, because, as every teacher who has taught online is familiar. There are many students who will use a lot of words to say absolutely nothing
      <p><strong>00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:12.029</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> right? And this is this becomes all the more common when, as when as AI increasingly becomes commonplace. In studentsâ€™ kind of
      <p><strong>00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.540</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> composition practices and
      <p><strong>00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.824</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> And so, while these forms of discoursing
      <p><strong>00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:34.109</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> are not silent in the sense that they're absent. They do engage a kind of silence in so far as they withhold
      <p><strong>00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.970</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> a lot of depth. They withhold forms of
      <p><strong>00:31:39.040 --> 00:32:02.829</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> engagement that we that we're hoping for from our students. And once again, I think that that withholding can mean a lot of different things. Sometimes, of course, students just don't want to do the work that's not unique to students. All of us don't want to do what our work sometimes, so I don't want to blame students too much for that.
      <p><strong>00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:12.470</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> but it is the case. Sometimes students don't want to do the work other times. Other times, students. They have other priorities.
      <p><strong>00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:25.781</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> you know, or similar to in class. They're not convinced that, you know, pouring their heart into a response is going to to offer them much
      <p><strong>00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.058</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> much good, you know. And I think,
      <p><strong>00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:38.900</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I think we can learn a lot from studentsâ€™ kind of forms of
      <p><strong>00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:47.248</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> disengagement online. I think maybe disengagement is a nice kind of corollary to silence.
      <p><strong>00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.750</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> because it can teach us.
      <p><strong>00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.630</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> It can teach us as educators how our students are perceiving
      <p><strong>00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.580</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> the work that we've assigned them.
      <p><strong>00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.099</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> the value that they see in that work.
      <p><strong>00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.670</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> And
      <p><strong>00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:18.710</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<stromg> while sometimes students just need needed, explain to them why certain work is important to do. Other times, I think, students.
      <p><strong>00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.270</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> her.
      <p><strong>00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:27.580</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> can we really onto something that what we assign them to do is perhaps not as useful to them
      <p><strong>00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.827</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> as we would like to think it is and I think
      <p><strong>00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:39.670</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> attending to their silences can be a really good kind of metric for us in that regard.
      <p><strong>00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:50.899</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Thank you. And staying on the topic of digital communication. Early on in our interview I did talk about how I wrote about grandeur in my thesis at Sdsu.
      <p><strong>00:33:51.600 --> 00:34:04.649</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> And I focus on the ideal body of men. How must they achieve love through the app? How do you see digital communication platforms like Grindr, influencing the role of silence in queer and disabled rhetorics.
      <p><strong>00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.949</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> To to elaborate.
      <p><strong>00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:27.330</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> because we talked early on about how Grindr is well known for a hookup app, and it may be like the misconception from other people like, well, you know, I found love on here, but others saying, You know
      <p><strong>00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:39.049</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> it's just easy to meet with a guy within your area, and simple as that. But do you feel that influences the role of science and queer and disabled rhetorics
      <p><strong>00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:54.159</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Well, I think that I think that apps like Grindr as a form.
      <p><strong>00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.530</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> as a as a kind of
      <p><strong>00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:11.470</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> as a platform on it like through which communication takes place. It provides certain conditions that
      <p><strong>00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.929</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> structure, the kind of silence that is possible.
      <p><strong>00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.570</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> So, for example.
      <p><strong>00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:37.630</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Grinder makes it possible for some queer people to engage in visual or embodied silences
      <p><strong>00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:45.850</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> that they could not engage through other forms of communication, particularly those that are Irl.
      <p><strong>00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.120</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Right?
      <p><strong>00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.210</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> So there there are some ways in which
      <p><strong>00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.080</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> grinder makes more silence more possible.
      <p><strong>00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:07.91</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> But there are other ways in which digital communication platforms, like Grindr can also restrict people's capacity for silence.
      <p><strong>00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:18.873</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Or, yeah, yeah, restrict people's capacity for silence and I think this
      <p><strong>00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:28.850</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> a good example of this is folks who, because
      <p><strong>00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:36.449</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> they choose to engage in a kind of visual silence or embodied silence.
      <p><strong>00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:42.060</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> they find it much more difficult to like, interact
      <p><strong>00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.509</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> with other users on the app
      <p><strong>00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:50.570</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> right. They are like verbally silenced because no one responds to their messages.
      <p><strong>00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:09.069</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> And I think that kind of that kind of silencing is a is not necessarily unique
      <p><strong>00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:18.570</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> to the platform, because that also can occur. Irl, where people just like don't respond to you. It is nevertheless conditioned by the app.
      <p><strong>00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:32.760</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I guess. What I'm trying to say is that I I try to resist thinking about
      <p><strong>00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.439</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> a single form of communication, as either like
      <p><strong>00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:50.130</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> good or bad, for silence, and more so, simply altering the forms of absence that are possible.
      <p><strong>00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:57.000</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> you know, in a, in a club or in a gay bar, there are.
      <p><strong>00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:12.589</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> there are forms of silence that people can engage there, too, that are not possible on on an app, you know, and these one example that comes to mind for me is folks who
      <p><strong>00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.080</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> are verbally silent, but are still dancing with people.
      <p><strong>00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:24.960</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> and like making physical contact contact, and like making out and like. There are forms of embodied presence
      <p><strong>00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:34.590</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> in person that require absolutely 0 verbal communication, whereas on an app like Grindr
      <p><strong>00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.769</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> there's there's always a verbal foreplay.
      <p><strong>00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:54.269</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Right? You gotta set it up. And so yeah, I I like that. I like that. Your question uses the word influence like, how does it? How how do these platforms influence silence rather than simply
      <p><strong>00:38:55.107 --> 00:38:57.019</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> create or constrain
      <p><strong>00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:18.630</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> No, I really like that example, because, like you said, you're in a club, and you're seeing someone in real life where on Grand or you're talking to, you know, sometimes a blank profile. You don't even know who you're talking to and like you said early on like that. That in itself is a form of talking. And amongst guys. So, I really like that.
      <p><strong>00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.510</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Thank you. As our last question.
      <p><strong>00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:29.259</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> how do you see your work, present and future, intersecting with emerging fields within fields, like digital humanities
      <p><strong>00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.970</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<storng> Oh, goodness! I was afraid you were. Gonna ask me this one.
      <p><strong>00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.270</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Well, I don't know if that's good or bad.
      <p><strong>00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:42.320</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> The reason I was afraid is because I
      <p><strong>00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:52.710</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I'm not entirely certain. I know what the digital humanities refer to. I think that
      <p><strong>00:39:53.140 --> 00:40:02.710</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I am. I continue to be interested in the myriad ways that people find
      <p><strong>00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:10.580</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> that that people adopt in in order to stay together and
      <p><strong>00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:19.360</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> increasingly, in this kind of like ongoing pandemic world.
      <p><strong>00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:36.880</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Where, or forms of fascism are kind of spreading globally in terrifyingly quick ways.
      <p><strong>00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:46.870</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Technology is is a dominant way
      <p><strong>00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:51.169</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> for people to stick together, for people to stay together.
      <p><strong>00:40:51.770 --> 00:41:02.470</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> And so, I find myself spending increasing amounts of time really studying and thinking about what
      <p><strong>00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:18.314</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> certain digital platforms make possible and what they, what they constrict or constrain, you know. Just as I was saying with in regard to your last question about the the role of silence on these platforms,
      <p><strong>00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:32.420</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> and something I something I've been trying to really work through in my head recently is the hmm.
      <p><strong>00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:39.200</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> What seems to be a kind of shifting era
      <p><strong>00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.589</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> in the world of social media.
      <p><strong>00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.039</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> where a lot of the platforms that
      <p><strong>00:41:47.160 --> 00:42:08.818</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> digital communities have grown accustomed to using in the last decade are are being abandoned. Platforms like Facebook platforms like Twitter, potentially, platforms like Tiktok, which continue to be legislated and in ways that make their their use very unreliable, you know.
      <p><strong>00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.360</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> and it's also the case that
      <p><strong>00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:24.340</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> in a lot of countries, platforms like Grindr are being heavily surveilled in ways that make them unusable for for queer people. So I
      <p><strong>00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:31.620</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I'm feeling as though we're in a really interesting moment where
      <p><strong>00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:47.359</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> the way people are engaging technology to stay together is changing. And so, even though I don't feel as though I'm prepared to comment on the quality or
      <p><strong>00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.290</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> form of those changes. I do think it is. It is a
      <p><strong>00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.246</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> an ongoing interest of mine.
      <p><strong>00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:06.679</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> I think it's also worth noting, too, that an increasing number of young people
      <p><strong>00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:16.840</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> are not using social media at all. You know they've grown up with millennial parents who were always on their phones.
      <p><strong>00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:17.635</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> and
      <p><strong>00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:18.940</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Yeah.
      <p><strong>00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:25.700</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> And, you know, have decided to adopt a kind of luddite aesthetic that
      <p><strong>00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:31.124</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> for for very good reasons, just does not engage
      <p><strong>00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:38.080</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> communication technologies in the same way. So I can't say for certain
      <p><strong>00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.029</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> how my work is going to take up these changes.
      <p><strong>00:43:43.525 --> 00:43:49.750</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Admittedly, the the book projects I'm I'm working on now are not
      <p><strong>00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:59.879</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> connected to these changes, but I can assure you there are things that I'm aware of and thinking about, and and will likely write about in the future
      <p><strong>00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.070</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> Awesome. Thank you so much for your time. Dr. Smolges.
      <p><strong>00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.230</strong> <strong>Logan Smilges:<strong> Of course I hope that my answers were helpful to you.
      <p><strong>00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.370</strong> <strong>David Ornelas:<strong> They were.
