          <strong>00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.629 David Ornelas:</strong>
          <span> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:28.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>
          <span> My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish, I usually tack on the 1st initial of my 1st name J, and my research interest’s kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</span>
        </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">What inspired you to start on your academic journey? And how did that lead you into writing your book, “Queer Silence: On Disability and Rhetorical Absence”?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.579 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span> Although your queer silence on disability and rhetorical silence book was big, how did that—what was your journey that sparked that? And then going into Crip Negativity, and the rest of your books?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.876 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Oh, goodness! Well,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:59.230 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Queer Silence, my first book, was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about 50% of my dissertation found its way into the book.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:17.280 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And I note that because my dissertation was very much the culmination of a series of questions that led me to grad school to begin with. I spent a good deal of my adolescence in conversion therapy</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.520 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> which</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:42.799 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> offered me a deeply harmful but nevertheless comprehensive framework to think about the relationship between sexuality and disability, and after finishing—and in many ways surviving—conversion therapy, I was left with a lot of questions about that relationship</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:59.540 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> between, well, my own experience of sexuality and disability, notwithstanding the disabilities I have that are somewhat independent, or not necessarily as intimately connected to my sexuality. And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> I entered grad school really wanting to understand better what I experienced and how the language we use to talk about disability and sexuality—particularly in relation—</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.890 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> can shape what people experience on an embodied level with these kinds of identities.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.652 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And so Queer Silence</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:47.369 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> was an attempt to answer a lot of those questions, and in the dissertation—the first iteration of that project—I was really primarily focused on sexuality and thinking about how people</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.579 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> within sexual minorities</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:12.480 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> have to drum up strategies to survive that don’t always seem or register to others as particularly radical or resilient, but nevertheless are highly effective at keeping people alive or keeping people safe. And then,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.669 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> when I finished</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.069 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> graduate school and moved toward the book, I felt a lot more freedom to think a little more expansively</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:40.009 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> about not only the relationship between queerness and silence, or sexuality and silence, but also disability — which, of course, is really the primary focus of the book iteration of the project.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.469 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And since Queer Silence, I have continued to be</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:45.610 --> 00:04:00.909 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference, about coalition, because something that I</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.069 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> learned in the process of writing Queer Silence was that the</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:26.159 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> tension we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.759 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> on a kind of rhetorical level.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:41.070 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> But it’s also one that has really deep implications for how queer disabled people understand themselves—how I understand myself.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.760 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:52.089 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> I have continued to write projects, to work on projects—including Crip Negativity and some of my</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:20.480 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> work since then—that try to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don’t always get along as well as we would like them to.</span>

        <button class="accordion-btn">The bodies you mention in your book, how are they mediated through technology? Do “bodies” serve one or many purposes that you’re conveying in your book?</button>

          <p>
            <strong>00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:46.930 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span> Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember in reading the 1st chapter or so of Crip Negativity. You talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Do bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.000 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.940 Logan Smilges</strong>
            <span>through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:25.221 Logan Smilges</strong>
            <span>There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embeddedness</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.640 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>through and in and in that chapter</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:42.730 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:43.150 --> 00:07:09.400 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. And I think there are lots of other examples we can</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.430 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>include.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:21.085 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:33.450 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness</span>
          </p>
         
          <p>
            <strong>00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:46.590 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.749 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>now that all said, I think</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.360 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I think there's also a degree to which</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:29.659 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. And in this way, I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:42.869 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>through like technological limbs. But or hearing aids, or also through other forms of assisted communication.</span>

            <span>that are also kind of technologically robust. So, in these cases, I back. I would back away a little bit from thinking about</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:05.185 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:25.690 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Vicea have written a lot about figures of crypt cyborgs that are such good examples of the real</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.410 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>harmony that can take place between bodies and technology.</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:45.619 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>You and I have been speaking, I think, since like 2021, and my master's thesis at SDSU was on Grindr, and I heavily resonated with what you wrote about on Chris has especially the chapter on Grindr.</span>

            <span>because what I wrote about my thesis was like the misconceptions that gay men have other gay men while on grinder in this digital space, where you don't know the person, you only see them through their profile picture and the bio they have, and whatever information they've included in that which leads into my next question is through your writing. Do you talk about queer digital spaces? And how do people embody them?</span>

          <p>
            <strong>00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.870 Logan Smilges:</strong>

            <strong>00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.869 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>Yes. So, through your writing, you talk about current digital spaces, but how do they embody them?</span>

            <strong>00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.060 David Ornelas:</strong>

            <span>Well, there's such a range, right? And I think this is one of the things that can make.</span>

            <span>on the one hand, so promising and enlivening, and also deeply frustrating for people who use them. You know, it's so rare to encounter a queer person who's like I love the apps, the apps make me so happy, you know. I just can't wait to finish my day at work. Sit down and get on the apps like nobody. Nobody says that right.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:24.628 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Everyone is upset about the apps. No one likes them, and yet they are so widely popular. Now, I'll be honest with you. I actually have not used like a queer dating app. Since, like 2017, it has been. It's been a long time since I have actively used them myself.</span>

And then I also feel you go to other dating apps, like, for example, hinge, and you have gay men on there. I think the premise of what men are looking for is completely different than what they're seeking on. Grindr.</span>

So even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, which I'm still not convinced everyone thinks it is, but even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, it still leaves us with so much room for disagreement.

            <strong>00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:13.700 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>citation is such a beautiful way of not only like amplifying voices. But it's also a way of acknowledging our own authorial limits</span>

            <strong>00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:57.839 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I think it's really useful to emphasize Silence's multimodality</span>

            <strong>00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:04.219 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>I love that you don't just center it on just like you said at the beginning of it, just being silenced like. It's much more than that.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.490 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>especially in academia. And you use that example of some students just sitting back and maybe just listening</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:19.299 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>and speaking up when they feel you know they want to contribute and stuff like that. But I appreciate you saying the silence is beyond just being quiet in space.</span>

        <button class="accordion-btn">In your book, you discuss anonymous online profiles. How do you think this affects “silence” and voices from marginalized identities, in digital spaces?</button>

          <p>

            <span>Shifting a little bit to online writing spaces. People do engage in silent discourse with that being said, does this complicate our understanding of identity and rhetorical silence in digital spaces</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:42.059 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Could I? Could I ask you to to expand a little bit on what you mean by silent discourse?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:27:42.560 --> 00:28:00.850 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>Yes, so I think I'm kind of referring also to again what you just said about silence within the classroom from cisgender students who maybe like not that they don't relate to the curriculum being taught, but they just feel like there's a distance between them and the curriculum in the class. So the silent discourse. That's kind of what I'm referring to.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.739 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Okay. So, folks who are participating in the discourse through their silence</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.300 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>Yeah.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.590 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Yeah.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.200 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Okay.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:34.320 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I mean, I think one of the one of the more challenging one of the reasons that this question is challenging is that silence can mean so many different things, right? Especially when it's coming from students. Some students are going to be silent because they've learned what we want them to learn, which is that it's okay to not speak</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:49.110 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>right. And they're intentionally engaging silence as a way of allowing others to speak. And that's great but there are other times when students engage silence, because they, because it comes from a place</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.099 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>of discomfort</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:15.740 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>when it comes from a place of insecurity. It comes from a place of perceived deficit where they don't feel they don't feel empowered to speak. They don't feel like they would be listened listened to, or maybe they're even afraid of forms of retribution or response, were they to speak? And so I think</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:27.390 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>it's very important to always take silence in context.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:29.420 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>It.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:53.159 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>It can be really dangerous, actually, to form kind of universal theories of what silence means. And this is one of the critiques that I offer in queer silence of how a lot of the history of queer activism has been predicated on rather universal theories of silence as a bad thing.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:03.760 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>But of course, that that assumption does a lot of real damage to the multiplicity of silences.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:14.820 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>You asked specifically about online writing spaces. Were you thinking about like social media</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:24.679 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span>That. Yes, of course. And just online work that's done that students have to do like for classic discussion boards or peer reviews, stuff like that</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>Oh, my goodness! Well, what comes to mind</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.732 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>with those examples? Like such a such as a discussion board?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:58.040 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>This is a great way to think about silence, not only as a kind of verbal absence, but as a kind of more multimodal gestural phenomenon, because, as every teacher who has taught online is familiar. There are many students who will use a lot of words to say absolutely nothing</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:12.029 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>right? And this is this becomes all the more common when, as when as AI increasingly becomes commonplace. In students’ kind of</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.540 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>composition practices and</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.829 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>And so, while these forms of discoursing</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:34.109 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>are not silent in the sense that they're absent. They do engage a kind of silence in so far as they withhold</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.970 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>a lot of depth. They withhold forms of</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:31:39.040 --> 00:32:02.829 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>engagement that we that we're hoping for from our students. And once again, I think that that withholding can mean a lot of different things. Sometimes, of course, students just don't want to do the work that's not unique to students. All of us don't want to do what our work sometimes, so I don't want to blame students too much for that.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:12.470 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>but it is the case. Sometimes students don't want to do the work other times. Other times, students. They have other priorities.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:25.781 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>you know, or similar to in class. They're not convinced that, you know, pouring their heart into a response is going to to offer them much</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.058 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>much good, you know. And I think,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:38.900 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>I think we can learn a lot from students’ kind of forms of</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:47.248 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>disengagement online. I think maybe disengagement is a nice kind of corollary to silence.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.750 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>because it can teach us.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.630 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span>It can teach us as educators how our students are perceiving</span>

        <button class="accordion-btn">In my own research from my master’s program, I focused heavily on Grindr and misconceptions of the ideal body men must achieve to find love.

          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Grindr makes some silences possible (like visual anonymity), but punishes others. People without visible bodies or profiles may be ignored. Silence becomes both tool and barrier depending on social expectations baked into the platform.</p>
