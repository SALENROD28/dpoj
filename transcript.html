          <strong>00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.629 David Ornelas:</strong>
          <span> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:28.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>
          <span> My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish, I usually tack on the 1st initial of my 1st name J, and my research interest’s kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</span>

        <button class="accordion-btn">What inspired you to start on your academic journey?</button>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.579 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span> Although your queer silence on disability and rhetorical silence book was big, how did that—what was your journey that sparked that? And then going into Crip Negativity, and the rest of your books?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.876 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Oh, goodness! Well,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:59.230 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Queer Silence, my first book, was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about 50% of my dissertation found its way into the book.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:17.280 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And I note that because my dissertation was very much the culmination of a series of questions that led me to grad school to begin with. I spent a good deal of my adolescence in conversion therapy</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.520 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> which</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:42.799 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> offered me a deeply harmful but nevertheless comprehensive framework to think about the relationship between sexuality and disability, and after finishing—and in many ways surviving—conversion therapy, I was left with a lot of questions about that relationship</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:59.540 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> between, well, my own experience of sexuality and disability, notwithstanding the disabilities I have that are somewhat independent, or not necessarily as intimately connected to my sexuality. And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.340 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> I entered grad school really wanting to understand better what I experienced and how the language we use to talk about disability and sexuality—particularly in relation—</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.890 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> can shape what people experience on an embodied level with these kinds of identities.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.652 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And so Queer Silence</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:47.369 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> was an attempt to answer a lot of those questions, and in the dissertation—the first iteration of that project—I was really primarily focused on sexuality and thinking about how people</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.579 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> within sexual minorities</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:12.480 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> have to drum up strategies to survive that don’t always seem or register to others as particularly radical or resilient, but nevertheless are highly effective at keeping people alive or keeping people safe. And then,</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.669 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> when I finished</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.069 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> graduate school and moved toward the book, I felt a lot more freedom to think a little more expansively</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:40.009 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> about not only the relationship between queerness and silence, or sexuality and silence, but also disability — which, of course, is really the primary focus of the book iteration of the project.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.469 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And since Queer Silence, I have continued to be</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:03:45.610 --> 00:04:00.909 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference, about coalition, because something that I</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.069 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> learned in the process of writing Queer Silence was that the</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:26.159 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> tension we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.759 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> on a kind of rhetorical level.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:41.070 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> But it’s also one that has really deep implications for how queer disabled people understand themselves—how I understand myself.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.760 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> And so</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:52.089 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> I have continued to write projects, to work on projects—including Crip Negativity and some of my</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:20.480 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> work since then—that try to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don’t always get along as well as we would like them to.</span>
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How are the bodies in your book mediated through technology?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:46.930 David Ornelas:</strong>
            <span> Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember in reading the 1st chapter or so of Crip Negativity. You talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Do bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.000 Logan Smilges:</strong>
            <span> Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.940 Logan Smilges</strong>
            <span>through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:25.221 Logan Smilges</strong>
            <span>There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embeddedness</span>
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How do people embody queer digital spaces?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Expectations vary widely on queer apps. While some seek hookups, others seek connection, safety, or identity affirmation. The same platform may be experienced as liberating or oppressive depending on these expectations—and people often list preferences that reflect deeper systems of exclusion.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Do you incorporate your lived experiences in teaching?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Yes, when relevant. I emphasize to students the importance of articulating their position in relation to the topic. Sharing my lived experiences—rather than just identities—helps foster deeper engagement and critical reflection.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How do you incorporate diversity and inclusion in your teaching?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> I center marginalized voices in my syllabi and design assignments that encourage students to see their own relationships to power. I don’t treat “diversity” as a checklist—I aim to reframe it as a lens for intellectual rigor and structural analysis.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">What pedagogical practices support rhetorical silences?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Silence is not absence—it’s a multimodal, gestural presence. I use silence as a teaching tool, allowing space for reflection, and I write about citation as a rhetorical silence—deferring to others who speak with greater authority.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How do anonymous profiles impact silence in digital spaces?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Silence online can be strategic or fearful. Students may feel disempowered or disengaged. We need to read silence in context, rather than make blanket assumptions about its meaning or value.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How does Grindr influence silence in queer and disabled rhetorics?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Grindr makes some silences possible (like visual anonymity), but punishes others. People without visible bodies or profiles may be ignored. Silence becomes both tool and barrier depending on social expectations baked into the platform.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How does your work intersect with digital humanities?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> I’m interested in how people stay connected in digital space amid rising fascism and social media collapse. I don’t know exactly how my work fits in the digital humanities, but I’m drawn to questions of survival, collectivity, and future building through tech.</p>
