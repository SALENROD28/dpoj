      <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish I usually tack on the first initial of my first name, J, and my research interests kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Although your *Queer Silence on Disability and Rhetorical Absence* book was really big, how was that like? What was your journey that sparked that? And then going into *Crip Negativity*, and the rest of your books?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, goodness! Well, *Queer Silence*—my first book—was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about half of it was revised from my dissertation, and then I added a couple of chapters, and took out a couple of chapters. The arc of it was there, but it changed a lot. And the journey that started it was truly the process of becoming disabled myself and navigating that through grad school, and all of the mixed messages that I was receiving about disability and about how we talk about disability and about who gets to talk about disability. So all of that kind of played into the questions that I was asking around the body, and representation, and identity and rhetorical scholarship. So those themes just carried through into the book. And then the second book, *Crip Negativity*, was a bit different. I got to be a little more creative with it. I didn't have to follow the same rhetorical studies structure that I felt like I had to with *Queer Silence*. And so with *Crip Negativity*, I wanted to really ask questions about how we represent disability and what kinds of affects are available for thinking about disability. And so I turned to a lot of cultural texts in that book, and that was kind of the crux of it. And then the third book, *A Queer and Transgender History of the United States*, was a different kind of project. That one was more of a popular press book. It was written with the general public in mind. And so the research process and the writing process were very different for that one.</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: And, since queer silence, I have continued to be really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference about coalition, because something that I learned in the process of writing queer silence was that the tension that we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is not what it once was, a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability on a kind of rhetorical level. But it's also one that has really deep implications for how queer disabled people understand themselves. How I understand myself, and so I have continued to write projects, to work on projects, including crip negativity, and some of my work since then that tries to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don't always get along as well as we would like them to.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember reading the 1st chapter or so of Crip Negativity, you talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability and the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Does bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?<p> 
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology. There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embodiedness through and in and in that chapter I claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. I think there are lots of other examples we can include. I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus encounter obstacles to gathering in community now that all said, I think there's also a degree to which technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies, but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. In this way I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like a technological limb or also through other forms of assisted communication that are also kind of technologically robust. So in these cases, I would back away a little bit from thinking about technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people, technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Weise have written a lot about figures of crip cyborgs that are such good examples of the real harmony that can take place between bodies and technology.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> You and I have been speaking, I think, since 2021, and my master's thesis at SDSU was on Grindr, and I heavily resonated with what you wrote about on queer silence, especially the chapter on Grindr because what I wrote about in my thesis was like the misconceptions that gay men have other gay men while on Grindr in this digital space, where you don't know the person, you only see them through their profile picture and the bio they have, and whatever information they've included in that which leads into my next question is through your writing, do you talk about queer digital spaces? And how do people embody them?<p>
        
      <p>Logan Smilges: Can you ask that? The kind of tail end of that question? One more time.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yes. So through your writing, you talk about current digital spaces, but how do queer people embody them?<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: How do people occupy these queer digital spaces?<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yes.<p>
                                            
      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, there's such a range, right? And I think this is one of the things that can make queer digital spaces on the one hand, so promising and enlivening, and also deeply frustrating for people who use them. You know, it's so rare to encounter a queer person who's like I love the apps, the apps make me so happy, you know. I just can't wait to finish my day at work, sit down and get on the apps like nobody says that right. Everyone is upset about the apps. No one likes them, and yet they are so widely popular. Now, I'll be honest with you, I actually have not used a queer dating app since, like 2017, It's been a long time since I have actively used them myself. They continue to shape my life because of how pervasively they're used in community right? It is increasingly strange for queer people to meet one another, in real life for the 1st time. Right? Even if it's not an app like Grindr, it'll be another app like Instagram or Tiktok, right? Like social media, specifically, has become such a dominant way that people meet one another, and so, as a result people bring lots of different expectations into these queer digital spaces, and I think this is what can often lead to the frustration that people feel specifically on apps like, Grindr, Jack’d, and Tinder, where the line between a sex app and a dating app can become a little blurry. It can be really not only confuse, but angering for some folks when another person is using the platform in a way that does not align with their own expectations for how they want to use the platform, or how they were hoping others will use the platform. And this you know, this is no more clear.<p>
        
      <p>Logan Smilges: This becomes no more evident than when you can read in people's bios their frustrations when they itemize all the things that they do or don't want from others who interact with them. Right? Sometimes they itemize certain physical characteristics, often in deeply racist and problematic and ableist transphobic ways.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: They will list expectations that aren't directly or explicitly linked to certain forms of embodiment, but nevertheless set out expectations for how one presents themself visibly, authentically, comprehensively, on the platform,and if this is you know, this starts to get into what I write about in queer silence about the kinds of profile pictures that people include. There's increasingly an expectation that people will show their face that people will be transparent with their whole identity right up front, and when people fail to do that, when a user fails to do that, it can spark lots of feelings<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yeah.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: There is.<p> 
        
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Both you and I know Grindr, I would say, is 99.9% a hookup app, but, like you said the way they men on the app, or try and body who they are is maybe not who they really are, but maybe to attract other men. Then I also feel you go to other dating apps, like, for example, Hinge, and you have gay men on there. I think the premise of what men are looking for is completely different than what they're seeking on Grindr.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Absolutely. Well, and I think even when we call an app like Grindr, a hookup app. What a hookup entails is still so variable, you know for example, there are a lot of disabled people whose interest and I guess this isn't even restricted to disabled people, but I'm thinking about disabled folks because of my own kind of community commitments. But for a lot of folks like virtual sex is the most accessible form of sex for them, or for, like, you know, for these folks like a hookup means sexting right, whereas for other users they will complain about endless conversations. Right? It's like, when are we gonna meet? When are we gonna get to the point? Right? So even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, which I'm still not convinced everyone thinks it is, but even if we were to agree that Grindr is a hookup app, it still leaves us with so much room for disagreement, and I don't think disagreement is bad at all.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: I think the reason that people are so frustrated and feel so intensely about differences on kind of or in queer digital spaces is because they expect homogeny, you know, they expect a kind of universal purpose. For these spaces, which has always been strange to me, because it is so counter to what queers have always been like when we gather. You know, we are always just defined by our differences. So it should make sense that we're not going to be the same among one another. <p>
        
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Do you incorporate your own lived experiences from your book or books or questions within your teaching? I don't mean, do you directly talk about Grindr in your classes. But do you? Do you talk about your own lived experiences in your teaching?<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Yes, when relevant something I really stress to students at all levels is the importance of being able to articulate your position in relation to the topic at hand. Whether this is a conversation we're having, or an essay that we're writing, it's so essential that we're able to articulate the stakes of the topic for us. Right? Why do we care? Why are we interested? Why should we be trusted as an authority about Xyz? And in order to state those stakes, I find it very useful to be transparent about my lived experiences, and I like that. You use the phrase, lived experiences rather than just identities because as I write pretty regularly, I'm very suspicious of the way that identity is increasingly used as a kind of synecdoche for politics, right? or used as a synecdoche key for authority on a particular topic, and that's not at all what I want to do when I position myself.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> How do you incorporate diversity and inclusion within your teaching?<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Diversity and inclusion.<p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Yeah, within your teaching.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, On a couple of different registers one would be curriculum. It's really important to me that my syllabi not only include, but center minoritarian voices on whatever I'm teaching, I predominantly teach disability studies and trans studies courses. And so within those courses, I'm not only trying to present, you know, the category of disability or the category of transness as this kind of as these kind of like monolithic silos, but trying to think about trying to think intersectionally about folks who continue to be marginalized even within these communities, and then centering or kind of trying to de-center those folks who consistently occupy most privileged positions within those communities. Right? So in the disability studies course, for instance, it's important to me that I really center indigenous black crip of color voices  because as you know, well, if any of us do not actively center those margins, then those margins continue to remain obsolete, or continue to remain voiceless in the conversation. So that's one way that I incorporate it another way, though it pertains more to pedagogical strategies that I use. I go to somewhat great lengths to design classroom activities that ask students to do the very work that I was just describing in response to the last question about positioning themselves in relation to the topic. Right now, I'm teaching a history of trans medicine course, and I teach a version of this course every year, and one of the challenges that appears most regularly is that cisgender students who, just because of demographics, tend to be most of the students in the class. They don't know how to participate because they feel as though the topic is so distant from their own lived experience, and so I find that part of my responsibility as an educator is to really is to really push students to think about.<p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Categories like transness as an effect of systems of power rather than just as a kind of innate, essential identity, and so helping students to position themselves within systems of like kind of or position themselves within sex gender systems and to be able to help them see their own proximity to power, to articulate their own proximity to power. All of us have kind of shifting proximities to power that to me is like the goal, the central goal of teaching, because if students are able to articulate their own position in the world. It is so much easier for them to understand their relationships with others which can help them know when it's time to speak up, when it's time to take a backseat, when it's time to listen and learn.<p>
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: So, I like to think that I'm thinking about diversity and inclusion, maybe not using those words per se, but thinking about the ideas related to diversity and inclusion on both the kind of curricular and pedagogical levels.<p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Yeah, totally. With *Queer Silence*, the audience was definitely the field. I was writing for other scholars in rhetorical studies, disability studies, and queer and trans studies. And with *Crip Negativity*, I was also writing for that same audience, but I was also trying to push the field a little bit. I was trying to ask the field to be a little more creative, to think outside the box, to think differently about how we approach our objects of study. And then with *A Queer and Transgender History of the United States*, I was really thinking about young queer and trans people who are just coming into their identities and are looking for some kind of historical grounding or affirmation. So yeah, very different audiences.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> What are you hoping students and scholars take away from your work?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, that’s a great question. I think what I hope people take away is a sense of expansiveness—that there’s not one right way to be disabled, there’s not one right way to be queer or trans, and there’s not one right way to write about or talk about those experiences. I hope that my work gives people permission to explore their own ways of expressing and embodying those identities.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> That was great! Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Smilges.</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Thank you! It was a pleasure to talk with you.</p>
