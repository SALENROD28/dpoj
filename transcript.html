      <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> So, Dr. Smilges. We know who you are, but what is your name and your research interests</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish I usually tack on the first initial of my first name, J, and my research interests kind of hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Although your *Queer Silence on Disability and Rhetorical Absence* book was really big, how was that like? What was your journey that sparked that? And then going into *Crip Negativity*, and the rest of your books?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, goodness! Well, *Queer Silence*—my first book—was loosely based on my dissertation. I would say about half of it was revised from my dissertation, and then I added a couple of chapters, and took out a couple of chapters. The arc of it was there, but it changed a lot. And the journey that started it was truly the process of becoming disabled myself and navigating that through grad school, and all of the mixed messages that I was receiving about disability and about how we talk about disability and about who gets to talk about disability. So all of that kind of played into the questions that I was asking around the body, and representation, and identity and rhetorical scholarship. So those themes just carried through into the book. And then the second book, *Crip Negativity*, was a bit different. I got to be a little more creative with it. I didn't have to follow the same rhetorical studies structure that I felt like I had to with *Queer Silence*. And so with *Crip Negativity*, I wanted to really ask questions about how we represent disability and what kinds of affects are available for thinking about disability. And so I turned to a lot of cultural texts in that book, and that was kind of the crux of it. And then the third book, *A Queer and Transgender History of the United States*, was a different kind of project. That one was more of a popular press book. It was written with the general public in mind. And so the research process and the writing process were very different for that one.</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: And, since queer silence, I have continued to be really invested in questions about solidarity, questions about being together in difference about coalition, because something that I learned in the process of writing queer silence was that the tension that we see in the historical record between queer people and disabled people is not what it once was, a persistent tension, one that continues to structure the relationship between queerness and disability on a kind of rhetorical level. But it's also one that has really deep implications for how queer disabled people understand themselves. How I understand myself, and so I have continued to write projects, to work on projects, including crip negativity, and some of my work since then that tries to take really seriously the feeling of tension, the kind of embodied feeling of contradiction and discomfort that comes along with occupying either multiple communities or multiple identities that don't always get along as well as we would like them to.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> Not to cut you off, and I know queer silence is the focus of this, but I remember reading the 1st chapter or so of Crip Negativity, you talk about your own experience in high school and the things you went through, and I wanted to touch base on that, because I feel that relates a lot to the queer silence and disability and the bodies you mentioned in your book for queer silence. How are they mediated through technology? Does bodies serve one or many purposes that you're conveying in your book?<p> 
      
      <p>Logan Smilges: Well, I think to answer that 1st question about bodies being mediated through or by technology requires that we really define what we mean by body and what we mean by technology. There is, of course, a chapter of that book, arguably the central chapter of that book that's thinking about Grindr and as a technology that you know a number that lots of users are negotiating their own bodiedness, embodiedness through and in and in that chapter I claim or argue that that app, and particularly the kind of visuality of bodies on that app, is in one of the important ways in which silence can be instrumentalized by queer people. As a way to modulate how much of ourselves we want to disclose at any given time, and that, regardless of how much we want to disclose technologies such as Grindr. I think there are lots of other examples we can include. I'll allow folks to continue to be in community with one another. To at least some degree. And so I think more broadly. Then there's a way that technology allows a degree of togetherness that can often be inaccessible for people who occupy bodies that are heavily stigmatized, heavily marginalized, heavily surveilled, and thus encounter obstacles to gathering in community now that all said, I think there's also a degree to which technology doesn't only serve as a mediation between bodies, but can also serve as an extension or essential component of bodies. In this way I'm thinking of forms of prosthesis, whether physical prosthesis through like a technological limb or also through other forms of assisted communication that are also kind of technologically robust. So in these cases, I would back away a little bit from thinking about technology as a mediation, and lean more into a kind of embodied extension, because for lots of disabled people, technology becomes a really intimate part of how they understand themselves. Folks like Alison Kafer and Jillian Weise have written a lot about figures of crip cyborgs that are such good examples of the real harmony that can take place between bodies and technology.<p>
      
      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> And would you say there’s a different audience for each of your books?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Yeah, totally. With *Queer Silence*, the audience was definitely the field. I was writing for other scholars in rhetorical studies, disability studies, and queer and trans studies. And with *Crip Negativity*, I was also writing for that same audience, but I was also trying to push the field a little bit. I was trying to ask the field to be a little more creative, to think outside the box, to think differently about how we approach our objects of study. And then with *A Queer and Transgender History of the United States*, I was really thinking about young queer and trans people who are just coming into their identities and are looking for some kind of historical grounding or affirmation. So yeah, very different audiences.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> What are you hoping students and scholars take away from your work?</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Oh, that’s a great question. I think what I hope people take away is a sense of expansiveness—that there’s not one right way to be disabled, there’s not one right way to be queer or trans, and there’s not one right way to write about or talk about those experiences. I hope that my work gives people permission to explore their own ways of expressing and embodying those identities.</p>

      <p><strong>David Ornelas:</strong> That was great! Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Smilges.</p>

      <p>Logan Smilges: Thank you! It was a pleasure to talk with you.</p>
