      <h2>Interview Transcript with Dr. Logan Smilges</h2>
      <div class="accordion">

        <button class="accordion-btn">What is your name and research interests?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> My name is Logan Smilges, and when I publish, I usually tack on the 1st initial of my 1st name J, and my research interests hover around queer and trans disability studies, rhetorical studies, and the history of medicine.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">What inspired you to start on your academic journey?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> My first book, “Queer Silence,” was based on my dissertation. I spent a good deal of my adolescence in conversion therapy, which offered a harmful but comprehensive lens for thinking about sexuality and disability. Grad school helped me make sense of that experience. The book evolved into an exploration of queerness, disability, and how language shapes embodiment.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How are the bodies in your book mediated through technology?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> I discuss apps like Grindr as technologies through which bodies are negotiated. Technology can mediate, extend, or even become part of the body—like with hearing aids or communication tools. For disabled people, tech is often essential to embodiment and community building.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How do people embody queer digital spaces?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Expectations vary widely on queer apps. While some seek hookups, others seek connection, safety, or identity affirmation. The same platform may be experienced as liberating or oppressive depending on these expectations—and people often list preferences that reflect deeper systems of exclusion.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Do you incorporate your lived experiences in teaching?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Yes, when relevant. I emphasize to students the importance of articulating their position in relation to the topic. Sharing my lived experiences—rather than just identities—helps foster deeper engagement and critical reflection.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How do you incorporate diversity and inclusion in your teaching?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> I center marginalized voices in my syllabi and design assignments that encourage students to see their own relationships to power. I don’t treat “diversity” as a checklist—I aim to reframe it as a lens for intellectual rigor and structural analysis.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">What pedagogical practices support rhetorical silences?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Silence is not absence—it’s a multimodal, gestural presence. I use silence as a teaching tool, allowing space for reflection, and I write about citation as a rhetorical silence—deferring to others who speak with greater authority.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How do anonymous profiles impact silence in digital spaces?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Silence online can be strategic or fearful. Students may feel disempowered or disengaged. We need to read silence in context, rather than make blanket assumptions about its meaning or value.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How does Grindr influence silence in queer and disabled rhetorics?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> Grindr makes some silences possible (like visual anonymity), but punishes others. People without visible bodies or profiles may be ignored. Silence becomes both tool and barrier depending on social expectations baked into the platform.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">How does your work intersect with digital humanities?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <p><strong>Logan Smilges:</strong> I’m interested in how people stay connected in digital space amid rising fascism and social media collapse. I don’t know exactly how my work fits in the digital humanities, but I’m drawn to questions of survival, collectivity, and future building through tech.</p>
