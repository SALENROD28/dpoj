  <h1>Reflection</h1>

<p><!-- Replace this with your own reflection text -->
Conducting this interview with Dr. J. Logan Smilges reshaped the way I understand queer silence and its relationship to digital spaces which includes spaces for students and spaces for gay men like Grindr. 
Going into the conversation, I expected and thought that silence was to function mainly as a lack of voice, or presence but that wasn’t the only case with what Dr. Smilges was referring to. 
Instead, the interview pushed me to see silence as a strategy, a form of resistance, and rhetorical choice that is often deeply intertwined with disability. 
Preparing the questions and transcribing the conversation made me slow down and really listen, not only to what was being said but pauses, hesitations, and tone shifts that carried meaning beyond words.

<p><!-- Replace with more reflection -->
Consider reflecting on how Dr. Smilges’s work on queer silence, rhetorical absence,
disability studies, and negativity influenced your understanding of digital spaces
and queer rhetoric. You can also discuss how their books shaped your methodology
or guided the direction of your project.

One of Dr. Smilges books, Crip Negativity helped me further understand the meaning of rhetorical absence, queer digital embodiment, and silence. Although my interview questions were based on the Queer Silence most of my questions were inspired from pieces of Queer Silence. Also, Crip Negativity and how Smilges’s critique of liberal disability politics shaped the way I thought about pedagogy, digital spaces, queer resistance, and identity formation.  
Although my questions in the interview were centered on college-based pedagogy, I found an excerpt from Crip Negativity that I feel opened the door for Smilges to expand across all grade levels, not just college. 
“But as my high school experience demonstrates, ableism casts a wider net than the language of access is able to capture. In my case, nothing about my education was inaccessible. I could get into the building and to all of my classes. I could understand the lessons and complete the assignments. I had a range of extracurricular activities I could choose from and participate in if I wanted. I had teachers who offered a variety of formal and informal accommodations to help me fulfill course objectives. And yet despite all this access, ableism still managed to make my life absolutely fucking miserable. If anything, I wanted less access, less contact with ableds, less time spent in spaces structured by neurotypicality, and less energy expended accommodating me into a community that exploited my neuroqueerness as an opportunity to ossify its superiority.” (Crip Negativity 3). 
Furthermore, Dr. Smilges work is groundbreaking that isn’t focused on just one subject or just one grade level but too everyone.

        In this drop down menu, I've provided quotes from both readings that I feel resonated
        with as well as was inspired from when putting together the Webtext. 
        
        1. "On Grindr, one cannot help but wrestle with the bodyminds of the users, both individually and collectively, 
        who are not only operating the accounts but visibly plastered all over the screen." (79).

        2. "For a Grindr profile picture, the studium might be white teeth in a wide smile, the size of a pectoral muscle, 
        or the density of a pair of eyebrows.These are features of a picture that users are trained to look for, that they 
        are meant to find appealing or at least to notice." (77).

        3. In these cases, the naked body itself can be a punctum, an epidermal jolt that fissures a viewer’s expectations 
        for masculinity, thinness, whiteness, and abledness that tend to define the genre of body pics. 
        But for those users whose bodies conform to normative expectations, the punctums of their body pics are less clear. 
        It’s these such pictures that sometimes leave me wanting more (because I’m horny) but don’t typically prompt my engagement. 
        Barthes feels similarly, writing that “there is no punctum in the pornographic image; at most it amuses me (and even then, 
        boredom follows quickly).” (95).
