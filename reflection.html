One of Dr. Smilges books, Crip Negativity helped me further understand the meaning of rhetorical absence, queer digital embodiment, and silence. Although my interview questions were based on the Queer Silence most of my questions were inspired from pieces of Queer Silence. Also, Crip Negativity and how Smilges’s critique of liberal disability politics shaped the way I thought about pedagogy, digital spaces, queer resistance, and identity formation.  
Although my questions in the interview were centered on college-based pedagogy, I found an excerpt from Crip Negativity that I feel opened the door for Smilges to expand across all grade levels, not just college. 
“But as my high school experience demonstrates, ableism casts a wider net than the language of access is able to capture. In my case, nothing about my education was inaccessible. I could get into the building and to all of my classes. I could understand the lessons and complete the assignments. I had a range of extracurricular activities I could choose from and participate in if I wanted. I had teachers who offered a variety of formal and informal accommodations to help me fulfill course objectives. And yet despite all this access, ableism still managed to make my life absolutely fucking miserable. If anything, I wanted less access, less contact with ableds, less time spent in spaces structured by neurotypicality, and less energy expended accommodating me into a community that exploited my neuroqueerness as an opportunity to ossify its superiority.” (Crip Negativity 3). 
Furthermore, Dr. Smilges work is groundbreaking that isn’t focused on just one subject or just one grade level but too everyone.
